<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>Recent outbreaks of various worms and viruses have demonstrated the importance 
  of keeping all PCs secure. These programs took control of hundreds of thousands 
  of computers, and their attempts to find more PCs to infect swamped the Internet. 
  And the big ones were relatively benign--they did nothing but attempt to propagate 
  themselves. Had they been programmed to do something harmful after taking over 
  a computer, it could have been much worse.</p>
<h2><a id="TheThreat" name="TheThreat"></a>The Threat</h2>
<p>Today's computing environment is extremely complex and interdependent. All 
  of the systems that make it work, from Windows running on your PC to the Internet 
  protocols that connect servers, are under constant scrutiny from a variety of 
  sources. Most of the time security problems are discovered by the "good 
  guys," security professionals in academia, business, and government. The 
  usual procedure is to report the problem to the company making the software, 
  give them time to fix it, and then make an announcement after a patch is available. 
  The alternative is to let the "bad guys" find the problem before anyone 
  else knows it is there.</p>
<p>The problem is that once a bug has been identified and announced, writing a 
  bit of code that exploits it is usually not difficult. Thus it is almost inevitable 
  that someone will write a piece of "malware" (malicious software) 
  and try to make it spread. It's just a matter of time--usually days. </p>
<p>Malware comes in two main varieties. Viruses are probably more familiar. These
   are malicious programs attached to email messages. Generally the user must
  open  the attachment itself for the virus to run--yet SoBig.F infected about
  150,000  computers. The second variety, worms, require no human intervention:
  an infected  computer will repeatedly pick a random Internet address and try
  to infect the  computer that owns it. This means the rate at which it can spread
  is limited  only by the available bandwidth, the number of vulnerable machines,
  and how  the worm is written. The SQL Slammer worm is estimated to have infected
  90%  of the vulnerable machines in the world in about ten minutes.</p>
<p>It is not clear how much harm recent malware authors intended to do. Some did 
  nothing but try to infect other computers. Others tried to bring down "establishment" 
  web sites such as those belonging to Microsoft or the White House. One patched 
  the computer it infected, fixing the security hole that allowed it to take over 
  the machine before other malware could do so!</p>
<p>However, even the "best" malware consumes bandwidth at an enormous 
  rate as it attempts to spread. The SQL Slammer worm, for example, all but shut 
  down the Internet in South Korea, as well as many ATMs, despite doing nothing 
  but propagating itself. When SoBig.F hit campus, traffic on SSCC's email server 
  almost tripled, and DoIT shut down their email server. Finally the malware must 
  be removed from each machine it has infected--estimates of the cost to clean 
  up after Blaster run in the tens of billions of dollars worldwide.</p>
<p>But it could be worse. Once malware has control of a computer, it could then 
  give control to the malware's author. Malware that does so has thus far been 
  much less widespread. There have been cases where private information such as 
  user names, passwords, and credit card or bank account numbers have been stolen 
  from the hard drives of infected computers. Some viruses install spyware used 
  by mass marketers. Infected computers have been used to distribute spam, pirated 
  movies and software, or pornography. Large numbers of infected computers have 
  been harnessed to attack a variety of web sites, flooding them with so much 
  traffic that they cannot respond to legitimate requests.</p>
<p>All of this makes it vital that every PC connected to a network be kept secure. 
  This is reflected in the <a href="http://www.cio.wisc.edu/policies/devices.aspx">campus 
  policy on networked computers</a>. Every computer attached to a network <strong>must</strong> 
  1) keep its operating system up to date, and 2) run up to date antivirus software. 
  Fortunately this is not difficult to do.</p>
<p> If your computer logs in to the PRIMO domain, we will take care of this for 
  you automatically. Just make sure that you tell your computer to restart when 
  you leave for the day, so that the patches can take effect and it will be all 
  ready for you in the morning. But for your home PC, or any other PC that doesn't 
  log in to PRIMO, follow the steps below.</p>
<h2><a id="UpdatingWindows" name="UpdatingWindows"></a>Updating Windows</h2>
<p>The ultimate defense is bug-free software that cannot be compromised. While 
  we'll never reach that ideal, every patch you install should bring you closer. 
  Recall that most malware depends on exploiting problems that have already been 
  identified and fixed. Thus if you've installed the fix on your PC, you are safe 
  from that exploit. Fortunately, having had to do this many, many times and having 
  been much criticized in the process, Microsoft has made it quite easy to get 
  patches that fix problems with Windows.</p>
<p>Start up Internet Explorer (surprisingly enough this won't work with other 
  browsers) and go to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a>. 
  You'll be automatically redirected to a Microsoft page with a name that's much 
  harder to remember. The first time you go to this page, you will be asked to 
  allow installation of a program that checks what updates you have and what you 
  need. It’s safe to allow this. If you choose not to, you will not be able 
  to use the automated Windows Update, and will have to locate and install updates 
  yourself.</p>
<p>After this plug-in is installed, your web browser will show a slightly different 
  page, with a place to click to <span class="MenuOutput">Scan for updates</span>. 
</p>
<p><img height="606" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/update_scan.png" width="642"/></p>
<p>Click on <span class="MenuOutput">Scan for Updates</span>, and it will identify 
  what operating system you have, what updates are available, and what updates 
  you already have installed. If there are any updates you need, that information 
  will appear on the left. You will be encouraged to install critical updates 
  first.</p>
<p><img height="649" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/Updates_1.png" width="642"/></p>
<p>The critical updates  are the ones that will prevent your computer from
   being infected. They deal with security issues or with problems in the operating
   system that will affect how your computer runs. Install all of these.</p>
<p>The Windows updates deal with a variety of less essential topics and issues. 
  Some are language-specific, and may of no use to you. Some deal with adjunct 
  programs that you may not have installed, such as the .NET framework or the 
  Windows Media Player. You can decide whether or not you want to install each 
  of these on an individual basis.</p>
<p>If your operating system is Windows 2000 or Windows XP, you will also see driver 
  updates. These are not required, but they are worth installing. Microsoft is 
  working with hardware manufacturers, and the drivers come from the manufacturers 
  – Microsoft is just assisting with distribution. However you may see better 
  results getting the drivers directly from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Click <span class="MenuOutput">Review and install updates</span>, and you'll 
  be given a list of critical updates to install. Click on another category and 
  you'll be given the list of updates to install for that category.</p>
<p><img height="649" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/Updates_2.png" width="642"/></p>
<p>It could happen that one or more of the available updates need to be installed
   separate from any other updates. That will be noted in the brief description.
   Otherwise you can install them all at the same time.</p>
<p>When you have removed any that you don’t want to install, click the <span class="MenuOutput">Install 
  Now</span> button. Sometimes you will get a license agreement box:</p>
<p><img height="411" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/Updates_3.png" width="380"/><br/>
</p>
<p>You need to accept the agreement in order to install the updates.</p>
<p>Then the updates will begin to download and install:</p>
<p><img height="240" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/Updates_4.png" width="330"/></p>
<p>When the installation is completed, you will be informed by a note in your 
  web browser. You may also need to restart your PC:</p>
<p><img height="139" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/Updates_5.png" width="617"/></p>
<p>You will have to restart for the updates to take effect. If it’s an update 
  related to a security issue, it’s best to restart immediately. If not, 
  it’s ok to wait until you are done working for the day.</p>
<p>Because some updates must be installed separately, finishing this process once 
  does not mean you're done. As soon as your computer reboots, go back to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com">windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> 
  and have it scan your computer again. It will tell you when there are no more 
  critical updates to install at this time.</p>
<p>Microsoft normally releases updates on the second Tuesday of every month, if 
  needed. Of course if there is an urgent problem they will release a patch as 
  soon as possible. So plan to update your computer every month, but if you hear 
  of any new virus or worm threats, take a moment to check if there is an associated 
  patch. </p>
<h3>Software updates</h3>
<p>Windows is not the only program out there with bugs in it. Most software is 
  not completely perfect and foolproof when it is released. Because of this, there 
  are often updates and patches for specific programs, just as there are for the 
  Windows operating system. Bugs in other software rarely pose the security risk 
  that a bug in Windows can, but they can cause problems for you.</p>
<p>For the most part, you should look for software updates, patches, and fixes 
  on the web site of the program developer. For example, check for WordPerfect 
  Office updates at <a href="http://www.corel.com">www.corel.com</a>. Most often, 
  they will be in a section called “downloads”, “support”, 
  or “updates.” Some more recently developed software can check for 
  updates for you, particularly if you always have internet access, and will tell 
  you when there is an update available. Each update should have installation 
  instructions. There is no standard way to install or update a software package.<br/>
</p>
<h2><a id="UpdatingAntivirusSoftware" name="UpdatingAntivirusSoftware"></a>Updating Antivirus Software</h2>
<p>A second line of defense against malware is antivirus software: programs that 
  detect and can usually eliminate malware. Good antivirus programs protect your 
  computer in two ways. The first and possibly more familiar, is that it can scan 
  your computer, searching your memory and hard drive for known malware. The second 
  is that it will run in the background and attempt to block malware when it first 
  attacks. This "real time protection" will usually prevent malware 
  from ever installing itself on your computer.</p>
<p>DoIT has purchased a license for Norton Antivirus that allows UW faculty, staff 
  and students to install it on their machines for free (see <a href="https://techstore.doit.wisc.edu/nav/nav_login.asp">https://techstore.doit.wisc.edu/nav/nav_login.asp</a>). 
  SSCC recommends you install Norton Antivirus (and this article will give 
  detailed directions for keeping it up to date), but you are free to use any 
  antivirus software you wish.</p>
<p>However, any antivirus software can only locate or block malware if it knows
   about it. When new malware is detected, the makers of antivirus software immediately
   go to work figuring out how to have their program defend against it. They
  will  then make new "virus definition files" available, telling their
  program  about the new malware.</p>
<p>But this does no good if the new virus definition files are not installed on 
  your computer. Good antivirus software makes this very easy. Each program is 
  different, but it should be fairly obvious how to update your virus definition 
  files.</p>
<h3>Updating Norton Antivirus</h3>
<p>Assuming you installed it, Norton should already be running in the background, 
  providing real time protection. If so, there will be a small yellow icon in 
  the lower right of your screen:</p>
<p><img height="15" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton.png" width="15"/></p>
<p>Start Norton Antivirus by double-clicking on this icon. If you don't see it, 
  <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ssc.wisc.edu">contact the Help Desk</a>. Once the Norton 
  window opens, click on the <span class="MenuOutput">LiveUpdate</span> button.</p>
<p><img alt="Norton Window" height="420" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton1.png" width="664"/></p>
<p>You'll be asked how to connect to the LiveUpdate server. Assuming you have 
  an internet connection just click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>.</p>
<p><img height="357" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton2.png" width="483"/></p>
<p>Norton will then check to see if any components need updating, including the 
  virus definition files.</p>
<p><img height="357" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton3.png" width="483"/></p>
<p>If there are any updates, Norton will obtain and install them automatically. 
  Just click <span class="MenuOutput">Finish</span> when it's done.</p>
<h3>Setting Norton to Update Automatically</h3>
<p>You also have the option of having Norton download the latest virus definition 
  files automatically, and this is highly recommended. In the main Norton window 
  click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Schedule 
  Updates</span>. You'll see the following:</p>
<p><img height="202" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton4.png" width="444"/></p>
<p>Check <span class="MenuOutput">Enable scheduled automatic updates</span> and 
  then click the <span class="MenuOutput">Schedule</span> button.</p>
<p><img height="257" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-12/norton5.png" width="413"/></p>
<p>Norton normally releases updates on Thursdays, but will release virus files 
  as soon as possible when needed. So for the best protection you may want to 
  update daily, but weekly will suffice. Choose a time of day when your computer 
  is likely to be on, but Norton will do updates later if it misses one.</p>
<h2><a id="ConnectingtotheInternetthroughaRouter" name="ConnectingtotheInternetthroughaRouter"></a>Connecting to the Internet through a Router</h2>
<p>Home PC's with broadband connections to the internet (cable or DSL) are more 
  vulnerable to worms in that they are connected to the internet continuously. 
  But you can easily provide a third layer of protection by connecting through 
  a router. This is not necessary (or possible) if you are using dial-up.</p>
<p>The original purpose of a router was to allow more than one PC to share a single 
  internet connection and IP address, but it has turned out to be a useful device 
  even if you only have one PC. When a PC behind a router requests something from 
  a server, say, a web page or an email message, the router takes the request 
  and sends it out as if it came from the router itself. But the router keeps 
  track of which PC made a request of which server so when it gets the reply it 
  can route the reply to that PC.</p>
<p>What happens if a "reply" comes that no PC requested? It is simply 
  discarded, and that's why a router protects PCs fairly well against worms. The 
  router will not route the worm's infection attempts to a PC because it knows 
  that no PC requested them.</p>
<p>Most routers also include a firewall. A firewall blocks illegitimate attempts
   to connect to your PC from the Internet, providing even greater protection.
   If you're buying a router make sure it has a firewall, but almost all of them
   do. </p>
<p>Simple, cheap, routers are available from places like CompUSA or Best Buy.
   LinkSys is a particularly good brand. Many routers include wireless capabilities,
   but these are typically more expensive. Installation is easy and should be
  well-documented.  Usually it's just a matter of plugging your cable or DSL
  modem into one side  and your computer into the other and then turning all
  three on. Everything should  happen automatically from there.</p>
<h2>Getting Help</h2>
<p>SSCC staff are eager to make sure your computer is secure--especially if it 
  is connected to the building network. If you are bringing a computer into the 
  building (laptop or desktop) please <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ssc.wisc.edu">contact 
  the Help Desk</a> to set up a time for us to both configure it for the network 
  and to make sure it is secure.</p>
<p> If you believe your computer is infected, please contact us at once. Just 
  one caveat--almost all email viruses forge the From: field in the messages they 
  send. So if someone tells you they got a virus that said it was from you, it 
  almost certainly came from someone else. On the other hand, what we'd really 
  like to do is help you prevent your computer from being infected. If for whatever 
  reason you have difficulty taking the steps described in this article, please 
  don't let that stop you. We'll be happy to help.</p>

<kb_title>Writing a CD Using Ahead Nero</kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>CDs are a cheap, convenient, and durable solution for backing up data or transferring 
  files from place to place. The SSCC strongly recommends that you keep backups 
  of your critical data on CD, or ideally several identical CDs. The long-term 
  archival qualities of CDs are not yet known--they simply haven't been around 
  long enough to see significant failures due to age. But they are more durable 
  than tapes or magnetic disks. CD readers are also ubiquitous--you'll rarely 
  have to worry about finding the right kind of drive to read your CD.</p>
<p>The SSCC makes CD writers available in rooms 2470, 3218, and 4218. If your
  PC has a CD writer, Ahead Nero may have come with it, or it can be purchased
  online. The SSCC does not provide CDs, though you may be able to get them from
  your department. We currently do not recommend "rewriteable" CDs,
  as some CD readers have difficulty with them.</p>
<p>Please be aware of copyright issues when using CD writers.</p>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>
<p>Before you can write files to a CD, they need to be copied to the computer's 
  local hard drive (<span class="MenuOutput">C:</span>). It will not work to copy 
  files to a CD directly from network drives like <span class="MenuOutput">U:</span>. 
  Your desktop is stored on the <span class="MenuOutput">C:</span> drive and is 
  a convenient location for temporary storage, though storing large files on the 
  desktop can reduce performance. If you need to write more than one file, put 
  them in a folder on your desktop so you can easily delete them when you're done 
  without accidentally deleting anything else.</p>
<p>Next put a writeable CD in the writer, shiny side down. It's not always obvious 
  which drive is the CD writer and which is the ordinary CD reader, but if Nero 
  tells you there's no disk in the writer, you probably need to switch.</p>
<p>Now start Ahead Nero, the program that writes CDs, by clicking <span class="MenuOutput">Start</span>, 
  <span class="MenuOutput">Programs</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Ahead Nero</span>, 
  <span class="MenuOutput">Nero-Burning ROM</span>. When the program starts you'll 
  see the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Setting up" height="372" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_5.png" width="614"/></p>
<p>If your CD has nothing on it, select <span class="MenuOutput">Start Multi-session
     disc</span>. If you already have data on the CD, choose <span class="MenuOutput">Continue
      Multisession disc</span>. If you choose the second, look carefully at the
      options  in the lower half of this windows, and make sure you set it the
      way you want.  There are no right or wrong answers for these, just personal
      preferences. The  default is fine if you don't care.</p>
<p>When you're satisfied with your choices, click <span class="MenuOutput">New</span> 
  on the far right. If you want to answer a number of additional questions on 
  the way, click <span class="MenuOutput">Wizard</span> instead. It’s not 
  necessary, but many people are used to seeing those options.</p>
<p>Either way you'll soon reach the window where you can decide what goes on your 
  CD:</p>
<p><img alt="Choosing what goes on your CD" height="453" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_4.png" width="642"/></p>
<p>The top half shows the tables of your hard drive and any removable or mapped 
  drives. The bottom half shows the tables of the CD. To place folders or files 
  on the CD, simply drag them from the top to the bottom. Watch the bar at the 
  bottom of the window to see how much room you have left on the CD. When you 
  are done, click the <span class="MenuOutput">Write to CD</span> button.</p>
<p>This will open a window for the actual copying procedure.</p>
<h2>Writing Your CD</h2>
<p><img height="372" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_1.png" width="614"/></p>
<p>If you are not sure of your CD, you can choose <span class="MenuOutput">Simulation</span> 
  as your <span class="MenuOutput">Action</span>, to make sure everything will 
  work all right. Otherwise stick with the default <span class="MenuOutput">Write</span>, 
  and click the <span class="MenuOutput">Write</span> button in the top-right 
  corner.</p>
<p>A new window will show you the writing process.</p>
<p><img alt="Writing the CD" height="504" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_2.png" width="492"/></p>
<p>You can stop the it at any time using the <span class="MenuOutput">Cancel</span> 
  button, but this will probably render your CD unusable if you do it after the 
  burn process has started.</p>
<p>When the your CD is done, you'll see the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Done" height="119" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_3.png" width="347"/></p>
<p>Click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>, and one last window will open, asking 
  what you want to do with the messages logged along the way.</p>
<p><img alt="Dealing with Messages" height="504" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-13/5-13_6.png" width="492"/></p>
<p>If you want to keep a record of the burn process, then choose <span class="MenuOutput">Save</span> 
  or <span class="MenuOutput">Print</span> at the bottom of this window. But you 
  probably want to choose <span class="MenuOutput">Discard</span> and not keep 
  the messages.</p>
<p>Once you make this choice, the CD writer door will open, and you can remove 
  your CD. This will also take you back to the window that you used for choosing 
  files to be placed on the CD. When you close Nero it will ask if you want to 
  save your setup. It won't load properly anyway, so click <span class="MenuOutput">No</span>. 
  Once you are done, don’t forget to delete any files you may have copied 
  onto your hard drive just for the purpose of creating this CD.</p>
<p>You can label the top of your CD with any permanent marker.</p>
<p>Before you rely on this CD, we strongly recommend that you test it. Put it 
  in a CD reader and make sure you can read it. Ideally use the same reader you 
  anticipate using in the future. For vital data, your complete dissertation research 
  for example, we suggest making two or three identical CDs and storing them in 
  separate locations.</p>

<kb_title>Printing on Special Paper</kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>SSCC users occasionally need to print on special paper, including letterhead,
   forms, or dissertation-quality paper. If you need to print a long document
  on  special paper, like a dissertation, please speak with the operator and
  they  will assist you. But for short documents on special paper, you can use
  the printer  in 2470. This article will tell you how to do so from Windows
  (if you are  using a different operating system you'll want to connect to one
  of the terminal  servers).</p>
<p>Please note that doing anything out of the ordinary with computers has a chance 
  of running into problems. You would be wise to bring some extra paper and allow 
  yourself some extra time when printing on special paper.</p>
<h2>Telling the Printer to Use Your Paper</h2>
<p>Start to print your document as usual, but make sure you use a method that 
  will allow you to choose the printer rather than using the default printer automatically 
  (typically <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Print</span>). 
  Select the printer called <span class="MenuOutput">\\print\SSCC2470</span>, 
  and click <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span>. The following picture 
  is from Microsoft Word, but you'll get something similar in most programs:</p>
<p><img alt="Choose SSCC2470 and click Properties" height="389" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-15/5-15_1.png" width="522"/></p>
<p>If the SSCC2470 printer is not available, you'll need to add it. See <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/5-24.htm">Setting 
  Up Network Printers in Windows</a> for instructions.</p>
<p>Once there, click on the <span class="MenuOutput">Paper/Quality</span> tab 
  and then set the <span class="MenuOutput">Paper Source</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">Tray 
  1 (Manual)</span>.</p>
<p><img alt="Choose Tray 1 (Manual)" height="416" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-15/5-15_2.png" width="464"/></p>
<p>Now take your special paper down to room 2470. Remember that this room is
		locked,  and you'll need your UW ID and a PIN to get in. If you do not
		have	a PIN, you 
  can request one by filling out the form available on the bulletin board outside
		 room 4226.</p>
<h2>Putting Your Special Paper in the Printer</h2>
<p>When you get to room 2470, the printer may be busy with other jobs. If so you'll 
  need to wait until your job comes up in the queue. When it does, it will print 
  a yellow cover sheet with your name on it as usual. It will then stop, and a 
  message will appear in the LCD window saying "Manually Feed Letter." 
  This is your cue to put your paper in the printer.</p>
<p>If you are facing the front of the printer, tray 1, the one you want, will
   be around on the right side of the printer. It is also labeled with a "1." 
  Use the handle to open the tray, and then pull to extend it. You can then place
   your paper on the tray. Put the sheet in face-down, with the top of the page
   away from you. When the paper is placed properly, the printer will automatically
   take it. You can then put in a second sheet if needed, and so forth (if you
   need to print many sheets the operator will use a different method that does
   not involve feeding the sheets in one at a time). When you're done, close
  the  tray.</p>
<p>Note that the printer will not print any other jobs until your job is complete! 
  Once you submit a job using the manual tray, please go to 2470 immediately and 
  make sure your job is completed as soon as possible. Otherwise jobs submitted 
  to the printer will just wait in the queue until your job is done, inconveniencing 
  your fellow users.</p>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>Web pages no longer need any introduction: it's almost taken for
            	granted that anything of importance can be found somewhere on
            	the web. This article will teach you the basics of creating
            	 web pages using Dreamweaver.</p>
<p>Our approach will be to some degree that of the HTML "purist," 
              meaning that we'll emphasize following HTML standards and using
              	 HTML the way it was intended. Web pages are different from printed
              	 pages in that they can be read by a variety of browsers, from
              	the  typical PC running Firefox or Internet Explorer, to handheld
              	computers,  to wireless Internet phones, to assistive technology
              	like screen  readers. All these devices will present a web page
              	in a different  way, but a page that follows HTML standards
              	will be clear and readable  in all of them. The problems
              	come when authors either don't understand  the purpose of HTML
              	markup, or intentionally misuse it to make their  page look the
              	way they want it to on a standard PC. Cascading Style  Sheets,
              	which we'll also discuss, give you more control over appearance
              	than HTML markup, are easier to use, and won't confuse other
              	browsers.</p>
<p>This document is intended for both novice web authors and web
            	veterans  who want to move up to Dreamweaver. It is a tutorial
            	in that we will go step by step through the process of creating
            	a sample page. Novices should follow all the steps--the only
            	way to learn web design is to actually do it. Veterans may want
            	to just read through for the techniques and then apply them to
            	their own pages. If you do follow all the steps,  be careful
            	not to overwrite your current web pages.</p>
<p>Web authors should be aware of the  University's 
              <a href="http://www.wisc.edu/wiscinfo/policy/wwwap.html">Policy
               Governing World Wide Web Accessibility</a>. There is no enforcement
               mechanism for this policy, but that does not mean
            	making  your pages accessible isn't the right thing to do. Fortunately,
            	writing proper HTML gets you most of the way there. </p>
<h2><a id="HTML" name="HTML"></a>The HyperText Markup Language</h2>
<p>The World Wide Web is nothing more than a collection of computers
            	 that promise to send out web pages when asked. Web pages (at
            	least the ones we're going to make) are written in HTML, which
            	stands for HyperText Markup Language. HTML was developed by physicists
            	 at CERN, and it shows. Fortunately we will rarely have to deal
            	with  HTML directly--we'll get Dreamweaver to write HTML for
            	us. But let's take a look at some just to see what it's like.
            	Consider this <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/files/HTMLSample.htm">HTML 
              Sample</a>. Now use your browser to look at
              the HTML  that creates this page: click <span class="MenuOutput">View</span>,
               then click on either <span class="MenuOutput">Page Source</span> or
               <span class="MenuOutput">Source</span> depending
               on what browser you're using. It starts with a bunch of information
               for your browser; the actual text starts after where it says <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;body&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>HTML uses "tags" to provide information about the text, 
              and a browser uses these tags to decide what to display to the user. 
              For example <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;p&gt;</span> marks the 
              beginning of a paragraph, and <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;/p&gt;</span> 
              marks the end. <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;h1&gt;</span> and <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;/h1&gt;</span> 
              do the same for a level one heading. If you compare the code you're 
              looking at with what your browser is displaying, you'll see that 
              your browser decided to make the level one heading big and bold. 
              Headings are examples of what is called "structural markup" 
              because they give information about the structure of the document.            </p>
<p>The next line says it's a level one heading, but if you look at
            	 the HTML markup you'll see it's really just an ordinary paragraph
            	 with some additional tags that tell the browser to make the
            	text big and bold. The next line does the reverse. It's just
            	some text that we want to be big and bold. This is considered
            	very bad form, and an example will explain why: screen readers
            	(programs that read web pages out loud for the blind) often denote
            	a heading by pausing before and after reading it. If we mark
            	headings as "big and bold" rather than as headings, or mark regular
            	text as a heading just to make it big and bold, we sabotage this
            	process. </p>
<p>The
            	goal  is to make sure that a page retains its functionality,
            	if not its appearance, no matter how it is presented. Screen
            	readers make good examples because having a page read out loud
            	is about as different from seeing it on a PC as it gets, but
            	the same principles apply to handheld computers, wireless Internet
            	phones, and devices we haven't even seen yet. The World Wide
            	Web Consortium (W3C, the people who write HTML standards) refers
            	to this as "transforming gracefully."</p>
<p>Most documents you've probably worked with (Word, PDF, etc) have
            	a single form. HTML pages do not. HTML pages are "rendered" by
            	the reader's web browser and different browsers
            	may render them differently. We add another layer to this
            	process when we choose to use an HTML editor like Dreamweaver
            		rather than writing the HTML ourselves. Dreamweaver will
            	translate what we write into HTML, which a browser will then
            	translate into what the user actually sees.</p>
<p>If this sounds
            	hard to control, you've got the idea. But
            	if you can give up on controlling the exact appearance of your
            	pages, you'll see how this flexibility allows your pages to be
            	used by the broadest possible audience without any additional
            	effort on your part. Nor does this mean your pages have to look
            	ugly: while controlling appearance with HTML is a bad idea, controlling
            	appearance is the whole point of Cascading Style Sheets, which
            	we'll cover as well. </p>
<h2><a id="RunningDreamweaver" name="RunningDreamweaver"></a>Running Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>The SSCC has made Dreamweaver available to all SSCC users on Winstat.
            	Please see <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/winstat.htm">Using
            	  Winstat</a> for instructions on logging in. When running Winstat
            	  you are essentially using a different computer. You may need
            	  to redo drive mappings and other customizations you are used
            	  to on your own PC.</p>
<p> If you are going to be using Dreamweaver on a regular basis you
            	 may want to consider purchasing a copy for your own PC. It is
            	available from <a href="http://www.doit.wisc.edu">DoIT</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="SettingUp" name="SettingUp"></a>Setting Up</h2>
<p>We'll start by setting up all the files and folders we're going
            	 to use in this tutorial. Most of the time you'll do your file
            	management through Dreamweaver, including putting files on the
            	web server itself. Your web folder on the server already exists.
            	It's called PUBLIC_web and is in your Linux home directory, also
            	known as the <span class="MenuOutput">Z:</span> drive. </p>
<h3>Creating a Local Folder </h3>
<p>Dreamweaver allows you to set up a separate folder where you can
            	 work on pages before publishing them to the world. Normally
            	the best place is in your Windows Network home directory. Using
            	Windows Explorer (or your favorite way of working with files)
            	make a folder in the <span class="MenuOutput">U:</span> drive  called <span class="MenuOutput">Web
            	 Site</span>. We're
               going to want some files we can play with later, so go to <span class="MenuOutput">X:\SSCC
                Tutorials\Web Class</span> and copy everything in this directory
                 to your new <span class="MenuOutput">Web Site</span> folder.</p>
<h2><a id="DefiningYourSiteinDreamweaver" name="DefiningYourSiteinDreamweaver"></a>Defining Your Site in Dreamweaver</h2>
<p>Now we're ready to start up Dreamweaver (find it by clicking <span class="MenuOutput">Start</span>,
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Programs</span>). The first step will be
            	to define your web site. You can use Dreamweaver to edit individual
            	pages, but many of the best features will only be available in the
            	context of a defined site. Setting up a site can be a bit confusing,
            	but it only has to be done once.</p>
<p>To begin, click <span class="MenuOutput">Site</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">New
            		Site</span>. Enter a name in the box under
            	<span class="MenuOutput">What would you like to name your site?</span> This
            	name is for your reference only, so you can put it anything you
            	like. Under What is the HTTP Address (URL) of your site, enter
            	<span class="InputCode">https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~</span> followed
            	by your SSCC username (e.g. <span class="InputCode">https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~rdimond</span>).
            	Then click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Site Definition, screen 1--name and URL" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_1.png" width="580"/></p>
<p>The next screen asks if you'll be using some sort of programming
            	language on the server. Choose <span class="MenuOutput">No</span> and click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen 2--server technology" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_2.png" width="580"/></p>
<p>Next you'll tell Dreamweaver where to store the "local" copy of
            	your files. Make sure <span class="MenuOutput">Edit local copies
            	on my machine, then upload to server when ready</span> is selected,
            	and then under <span class="MenuOutput">Where
            	on your computer do you want to store your files?</span> type the
            	directory you set up earlier, <span class="InputCode">U:\Web Site</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen 3--local folder" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_3.png" width="580"/></p>
<p>Now you'll tell Dreamweaver where to put files that are ready
            	to be published on the web server. Set <span class="MenuOutput">How
            	do you connect to your remote server?</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">Local/Network</span>.
            	Under <span class="MenuOutput">What folder on your server do you
            	want to store your files in?</span> type <span class="InputCode">z:\PUBLIC_web</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen 4--remote settings" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_4.png" width="580"/></p>
<p>Dreamweaver will then ask if you want to enable checking in and
            	out files. You might want to turn this on if there are lots of
            	people who work on the site, but for your own pages choose <span class="MenuOutput">No</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Screen 5--check in/out" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_5.png" width="580"/></p>
<p>The last screen just confirms the information you've entered.
            	Look it over, and if everything is okay click <span class="MenuOutput">Done</span>. If not, click
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Back</span> until you get to the relevant screen and make corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="Screen 6--confirmation" height="574" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_6.png" width="580"/></p>
<h3>Saving Your Site Definition</h3>
<p>Unfortunately Dreamweaver on Winstat has a problem where it occasionally drops site definitions. (Winstat, being a Windows Terminal Server, is not quite like a regular Windows PC and this is one case that causes trouble.) However, you can save your site definition as a file which you can load in case this happens to you.</p>
<p>Click <span class="MenuOutput">Site</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Manage Sites</span>, make sure your web site is selected, and then click <span class="MenuOutput">Export</span> and <span class="MenuOutput">Save</span>. This will save the site definition file in your local web directory.</p>
<p>If Dreamweaver does drop your site definition, you'll probably notice when you can no longer put files on the web server (since Dreamweaver doesn't know where to put them). At that point you should click <span class="MenuOutput">Site</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Manage Sites</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Import</span> and select the site definition file. You'll then be back to normal.</p>
<h2>The Dreamweaver Workspace</h2>
<p>Dreamweaver has a tendency to make too much available at once
            	(one suspects they wanted to impress people who are evaluating
            	the program with how much it can do). Fortunately you can close
            	the panels you don't need. The panels you're most likely to need
            	are <span class="MenuOutput">Files</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span>,
            	and <span class="MenuOutput">CSS</span>. To close the others, right-click
            	on their names and choose <span class="MenuOutput">Close panel group</span>.
            	This would leave you with the following layout:</p>
<p><img alt="Workspace with suggested panels" height="493" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_7.png" width="640"/></p>
<p>Note that this picture is not of a full screen--you'll probably
            	have much more room. But as you're writing you may want even
            	more. Just press <span class="InputCode">F4</span> to make the document
            	fill the entire Dreamweaver window. Alternatively you can click
            	the small black triangles between the document and the panels
            	at the right and bottom to close them temporarily. Click the
            	arrows again to get the panels back. You can also control what
            	panels you see by clicking on <span class="MenuOutput">Window</span> at
            	the top.</p>
<h2><a id="YourHomePage" name="YourHomePage"></a>Your Home Page</h2>
<p>At long last, let's make a web page. Click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">New</span>.
            	Then choose the <span class="MenuOutput">Basic page</span> category and <span class="MenuOutput">HTML</span>, then click <span class="MenuOutput">Create</span>.</p>
<p><img alt="Creating a basic HTML page" height="503" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_9.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>You'll get a blank page. Dreamweaver will have an easier time
            	creating links if it knows where this file will be, so let's
            	save it right away. Click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Save
            	as</span>, and give it the name <span class="InputCode">home.htm</span>.
            	If someone goes to your web site but does not specify what page
            	they want they'll be given <span class="MenuOutput">home.htm</span> if
            	it exists, so that makes a logical starting point.</p>
<h3>Page Title </h3>
<p>The first thing we'll do is set a title for the page. This is
            	what will show up in the title bar of the user's browser while
            	they're looking at the page. Leaving the page title set to "Untitled
            	Document" makes the reader think "newbie web author."</p>
<p>Make sure the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> pane
            	is open at the bottom of your screen. Then make sure it's set
            	to full size by clicking on the small triangle in the lower right.
            	Then you should see a button labeled
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Page Properties</span>.</p>
<p>Click on it, and you'll get a new window with a variety of settings.
            	Select the <span class="MenuOutput">Title/Encoding</span> category. In the <span class="MenuOutput">Title</span> box,
            	type a title for the page--something like "<span class="InputCode">&lt;Your
            	Name&gt;'s Home Page</span>." Ignore
            	the other settings for now and click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Setting the page title" height="387" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_10.png" width="603"/> </p>
<p>This window also allows you to control many aspects of the appearance
            	of your page. We're not talking about controlling appearance
            	right now, and when we do we'll do it a bit more directly. But you
            	may want to make a note of this window for future use. </p>
<h3>Text and Headings </h3>
<p>Let's start with just some text. Type in <span class="InputCode">&lt;Your
            		 Name&gt;'s Home Page</span>. As you see the text appears
            		 on the page just as if you were working in Word. You may
            		 be tempted at this point to  change the appearance of these
            		 words--to make them bigger or something. But before you
            		 reach for the <span class="MenuOutput">Size</span> menu
            		 on the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> panel, ask yourself
            		 why you think these words ought to be bigger.</p>
<p>The reason (translated into HTML terms) is that they are a heading,
            	specifically a level one heading. You can mark them as such by
            	selecting the words, then going to the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> panel
            	and setting
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Format</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">Heading
            	1</span>. Note that Dreamweaver immediately made the words big and
            	bold, and this is what a standard web browser will do as well.
            	However, non-standard browsers will also find a way to tell the
            	reader that this is a heading, ways that may have nothing to
            	do with size or font.</p>
<p>Recall that the HTML "tag" for a level one heading is <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;h1&gt;</span>.
            	If you look in the lower left corner of the document window,
            	you'll see <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;</span> in
            	the border of the window (if you don't see the <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;h1&gt;</span> make
            	sure the cursor is somewhere in the heading of the page). This
            	shows the tags that apply at the current location of the cursor.
            	This is a great way to learn HTML, and once you know some HTML
            	it's a great way to see how Dreamweaver is turning your ideas
            	into HTML. </p>
<h3>Images</h3>
<p>It's almost too simple to put images in a web page. It's easy
            	when you are on campus with a direct connection to the Internet
            	to ignore how big your pictures are and how long it will take
            	for them to download. But let's do it anyway. </p>
<p>Move the cursor to a new line and either press <span class="InputCode">CRTL-ALT-i</span> 
              or click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Image</span>.
               Then select <span class="MenuOutput">uwlogo.gif</span>. You'll
               immediately be asked to set the <span class="MenuOutput">Alternate
               text</span>. Type in <span class="InputCode">University of Wisconsin-Madison </span>               and
               click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Setting an ALT text" height="202" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_11.png" width="477"/></p>
<p>This is perhaps the most important thing you can do to make your
            	page accessible to people with disabilities, so it deserves some
            	 explanation. The <span class="MenuOutput">Alternate text</span> is
            	what a browser will display if it cannot display the image itself.
            	It could be a simple as the user turning off images to save loading
            	 time, or it could be that the user is blind and the
            	page is being read to them. Alternate texts must be short, so
            	if you need to give a longer description you'd put it in a separate
            	web page and put the URL of that web page in <span class="MenuOutput">Long
            	description</span>. This is rarely necessary--normally you'd  only
            	do this if a graph or diagram is a critical part of the information
            	you're trying to convey.</p>
<p>The alternate text for this image was a no-brainer, since the
            	image is just a picture of text in a particular format. In general
            	choosing good alternate texts is an art form, but the basic principle
            	is to convey the same information that the image is trying to
            	convey. Do not attempt to describe what the image looks like.
            	Someone who is blind doesn't care that in our image the
            	words are red!</p>
<p> If an image is purely decorative, click the drop-down
            	menu to the right and choose <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;empty&gt;</span>.
            	Keep in mind that screen reader programs cannot skip ahead the
            	way a sighted reader can, so hearing "Picture of the Sewell
            	Social Sciences Building on a sunny day with a few puffy clouds
            	and the Carillon tower visible in the foreground" every time
            	they load your page probably won't be appreciated. Graphical
            	layouts containing dozens of tiny images with the alternative
            	text of "Spacer" are even worse.  On the other hand, setting
            	the alternate text to <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;empty&gt;</span> is
            	very different from not setting it at all. One says "this image
            	conveys no important information." The other says "I really
            	didn't pay any attention to accessibility issues, so for all
            	you know this entire page is useless if you can't see this image."</p>
<p>At the bottom of the screen there is a little box that says how
            	 big your page is and how long it will take to download on a
            	28.8 modem. This is a conservative estimate of how long it would
            	take someone to download your page at home on a dial-up connection.
            	People with cable or DSL, or who are on campus, will be able
            	to download it much more quickly. Thus "how big is too big?"
            	depends on your intended audience. If you do decide that your
            	page is bigger than you want it to be, focus on the images. A
            	picture may be worth a thousand words, but a thousand words will
            	download much more quickly.</p>
<h2><a id="Links" name="Links"></a>Links</h2>
<p>The whole point of the web is to link information together in
            	logical  ways. So let's learn how to make links. Let's pretend
            	you are teaching a course and want to make a link on your home
            	page to the course calendar. We'll make a new section
               by pressing <span class="InputCode">CTRL-2</span> (level two heading)
                and typing <span class="InputCode">Teaching</span>. Note how
                the level two heading is a subsection of the level one heading
                (your home page). Now go to the next line and type <span class="InputCode">Course
                Calendar</span>. </p>
<p>There are many ways to
            	turn text into a link, but they all start by selecting the text.
            	Then you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type the name of the web page you want to link to in the <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span>            		box
            		of the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> panel</li>
<li>Drag the small circle to the right of the <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span> box to the file
            		in the <span class="MenuOutput">File</span> panel you want to link to</li>
<li>Click <span class="MenuOutput">Modify</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Make
            			Link</span> or press <span class="InputCode">CTRL-l</span>, then
            			select the file you want to link to </li>
</ul>
<p>If you plan ahead, you can insert both the text and the link at
            	the same time by clicking <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Hyperlink</span>. If you do, note
            	that the only boxes you'll usually fill out are <span class="MenuOutput">Text</span> (the
            	text the user will read) and <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span>,
            	the file you're linking to.</p>
<p>In this case what we want to link to is <span class="MenuOutput">calendar.htm</span>,
            	so choose one of the methods above and make <span class="MenuOutput">Course
            	Calendar</span> a
            	link to it. You'll know it worked when the words are blue and
            	underlined. </p>
<p>By default Dreamweaver will use what are known as
            	document-relative links, and normally that's what you want. If
            	the link just says <span class="MenuOutput">calendar.htm</span> that
            	means the server should look for a file with that name in the
            	same directory as the file you're currently reading. The advantage
            	to this approach is that you can pick up the whole web site,
            	move it somewhere else, and all the links will still work. </p>
<p>Now let's add a research section. 
              Create a level two heading called <span class="InputCode">Research</span> 
              and under it type <span class="InputCode">Data</span>. Make that
              a link to the file <span class="MenuOutput">data.dta</span>, and
              just for fun use a different method than the one you used before. </p>
<p>You may be  wondering what kind of data this is and how someone
            	is going to be able to read it. These are excellent questions.
            	You can put any kind of file you want on the web, but consider
            	ahead of time whether your intended audience will be able to
            	do anything with it. For example, <span class="MenuOutput">data.dta</span> is
            	a Stata data set, and only people who have Stata on their computers
            	will be able to open it. And while Stata is pretty
            	well-behaved, the data files of other programs may be unreadable
            	by different versions of the same program or the same program
            	running on different types of computers. You're usually safe
            	in assuming that everyone has or can get Adobe Reader and can
            	thus read PDF files. Most people have programs that can read
            	Word and Excel files (notably, Word and Excel). But before you
            	put anything but web pages on the web, find out as much
            	as you can about your intended audience and what they have available,
            	experiment, and plan ahead. There is nothing more frustrating
            	than rushing to meet a deadline and suddenly realizing your collaborators
            	can't read the files you're trying to share with them.</p>
<p>Now let's link to something outside your web site. Since it is
            	outside your  site, you need to tell the reader's browser
            	exactly how to find it, right down to the protocol (normally
            	http). If you know
            	the URL of the page you are linking to you can type it in the
            	Link box of the Properties panel, but that's asking for typos.
            	You can avoid that by first finding the page you want in a web
            	browser, then copying the address from the browser and pasting
            	it into Dreamweaver. That way you know it's correct.</p>
<p>Open a web browser and go to the SSCC's home page (<a href="http://ssc.wisc.edu/">http://ssc.wisc.edu/</a>).
            	Copy the tables of the address bar and then switch back to
            	Dreamweaver. At the end of your web page type <span class="InputCode">The
            	host of this web site</span> (this is an exercise--there's no need
            	to put this link in an actual web page even if it is hosted on
            	the SSCC's web server). Select that text, click inside the <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span> box
            	in the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> panel so that
            	the cursor is there, and then either right-click and choose <span class="MenuOutput">Paste</span> or
            	press <span class="InputCode">CTRL-v</span>. The URL you pasted
            	should appear in the <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span> box and
            	the text will turn into a link to the SSCC home page.</p>
<p>Note that we did not use the <span class="MenuOutput">Make Link</span> dialog box to do this--it
            	doesn't like addresses that don't include a specific file.</p>
<h3>Email Links</h3>
<p>When the reader clicks on an email link, the browser attempts
            	to open the default mail program on their computer, then creates
            	a message addressed to the address in the link. Thus email links
            	provide a very simple way for your audience to contact you. </p>
<p>The University Accessibility Policy requires that every web page
            	 name a person to contact if someone cannot access the page,
            	so we'll fulfill that requirement and learn to make an email
            	link at the same time. Type <span class="InputCode">If
            	you have trouble accessing this page, please contact: {<span class="Parameter">your
            	name</span>}
            	({<span class="Parameter">your
            	email address</span>}</span>). 
            	Select your email address and click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, 
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Email Link</span>. Since the text you selected
            	is an email address, Dreamweaver will cleverly deduce that that's
            	the address you want to the reader to send mail to when they
            	click on it.</p>
<p><img alt="Inserting an email link" height="142" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_12.png" width="405"/></p>
<p>So why didn't we just make your name the link? Not
            	everyone uses an email program that communicates with a browser.
            	They'll need to enter your email address themselves, so you need
            	to put it in the text where they can read it.</p>
<h3><a id="NamedAnchors" name="NamedAnchors"></a>Named Anchors</h3>
<p>Our page isn't really long enough to need this yet, but let's
            	put  in a link that takes us back to the top of the page. At
            	the very bottom type <span class="InputCode">Back to Top</span>.
            	Select it and in the <span class="MenuOutput">Link</span> box type <span class="InputCode">#Top</span>.
            	 This will take us to an anchor called <span class="InputCode">Top</span> 
              within this document. Think of an anchor as a bookmark, except
              it  must be placed by the author.</p>
<p>All we need now is an anchor called <span class="InputCode">Top</span>. 
              Move the cursor to the very beginning of the document, then click 
              on <span class="MenuOutput">Insert, Named Anchor</span> 
              (or you can press <span class="InputCode">CTRL-ALT-A</span>). You'll 
              get the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Inserting a named anchor" height="133" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_13.png" width="377"/></p>
<p>Type <span class="InputCode">Top</span> for the <span class="MenuOutput">Anchor 
              Name</span>. You'll see a yellow thing with an anchor on it to the 
              left of your title. Rest assured it will not be visible when viewed 
              in a browser. But when the user clicks on the <span class="InputCode">Back 
              to Top</span> link, the browser will jump to this anchor.</p>
<h3>Navigation Bars</h3>
<p>One very useful feature for almost any web site is a navigation
            	 bar which  allows quick access to the most important pages
            	on your site. See the <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu">SSCC Home
            	Page</a> for
            	an example (the stuff on the left). Once your web site has more
            	than one page in it, consider putting together a navigation bar
            	so readers can get to all of them. A navigation bar is just a
            	list of links. The challenging part is seeing your web site from
            	the point of view of the reader and helping them get to what
            	they're looking for quickly and easily.</p>
<h2><a id="Lists" name="Lists"></a>Lists</h2>
<p>Lists are a very common structure in documents, and HTML handles
            	 them very easily. Let's make the link under <span class="MenuOutput">Teaching</span> 
              the beginning of an official list of links. First select the link
               text <span class="MenuOutput">Course Calendar</span>. Now under <span class="MenuOutput">Text</span> 
              on the menu bar select <span class="MenuOutput">List </span>and<span class="MenuOutput">
</span>then <span class="MenuOutput">Unordered List</span>. This
               will create a bullet list, while an <span class="MenuOutput">Ordered
                list</span> will be numbered.  If you are
                in a list element and hit <span class="InputCode">ENTER</span>,
                  Dreamweaver will automatically create a new list element for
                 you--just be sure you don't have  text selected, or you'll
                replace it instead. Keep in mind that lists are structural markup.
                They should be used for actual lists, not just to get indentation
                or other presentational effects.</p>
<h2><a id="Tables" name="Tables"></a>Tables</h2>
<p>Tables were included in HTML so people could put tables of data
            	in web pages. However, people rapidly figured out that you could
            	use a table to control the layout of your web page. This is definitely
            	a case of using structural markup for presentational purposes,
            	but the alternative (positioning by CSS) is a lot harder to do
            	and much less reliable. Poorly designed layout tables can wreak
            	havoc with screen readers and other browsers that can only deal
            	with a small part of the page at a time. But if you're aware
            	of the issues it's easy to create tables which will work just
            	fine. </p>
<p>Our web page is getting a bit long, but there's plenty of blank 
              space on the right side. Let's move the Teaching section and the 
              Research section into two parallel columns. Put the cursor just 
              above <span class="InputCode">Teaching</span> and click on <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, 
              then <span class="MenuOutput">Table</span>. You'll see the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Inserting a table" height="422" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_14.png" width="414"/></p>
<p>We want one row (why in a moment) and two columns. We'll adjust
            	the width later so it doesn't really matter what you set it
            	to for now. We want a border on our table, but if you didn't
            	you could set <span class="MenuOutput">Border
            	thickness</span> to <span class="InputCode">0</span>. </p>
<p>The accessibility features are mostly intended for data tables.
            	The structure of a data tables can be hard to understand if you
            	cannot see the entire table at once. Use the captions and
            	summaries to explain that structure. However, for layout
            	tables, like we're doing, there's usually nothing to summarize.</p>
<p>Now drag the entire  Teaching section into the left table cell,
            	and the entire  Research section into the right table cell. Of
            	course it's usually more efficient to make the table first and
            	then make the stuff that will go inside it. </p>
<p>Now that the table is in place, you can decide if you like the
            	look of it. If not, click on <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;table&gt;</span> in
            	the bottom border of the document window. Then the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span> panel
            	will show the properties of the table.</p>
<p>The table width is in the box marked <span class="MenuOutput">W</span>.
            	This can be measured either in pixels or percents. Using percents
            	is highly recommended, as screen sizes vary. Try 70% for this
            	table. Alternatively you can delete everything in that box and
            	let the browser decide--it will choose a width just big enough
            	to fit everything in the table. This makes for a very flexible
            	design.</p>
<p>Cell padding (<span class="MenuOutput">CellPad</span>) will leave
            	some space around the text in the tables, making them easier
            	to read and less cluttered-looking. Try 10 to see the effect.</p>
<p>You can adjust the column widths simply by dragging the column
            	border. If the table width is measured in percentages the column
            	widths will be too. </p>
<p>To adjust parts of the table it helps to know what HTML calls
            	them. The <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;tr&gt;</span> tag stands
            	for "table row" while <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;td&gt;</span> is
            	"table data" or a single cell. Thus to adjust a particular
            	cell, click inside that cell and then click the <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;td&gt;</span> tag
            	at the bottom of the screen to see the properties of the cell
            	itself.</p>
<p>You'll often finding yourself changing the alignment of individual
            	cells. <span class="MenuOutput">Horz</span> and <span class="MenuOutput">Vert</span> control
            	the horizontal and vertical alignment respectively of the text
            	within the cell. To see it in action, add some blank lines to
            	one cell so it's now longer than the other. You'll notice that
            	the <span class="MenuOutput">Teaching</span> and <span class="MenuOutput">Research</span> headings
            	no longer line up. That's because the default is to center them
            	within the cell, so as the cells got taller, the text in the cell
            	with less table moved down. You can fix that by setting <span class="MenuOutput">Vert</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">Top</span> for
            	both cells--that way they'll both start at the top regardless
            	of their relative sizes. </p>
<p>Given that our sections consist of rows of text, you might think
            	it would make sense to make a table with multiple rows. If you
            	set the borders properly you could even make it look identical.
            	But to a screen reader, the result would be completely different.
            	Screen readers read tables from left to right and then top to
            	bottom. Thus it reads an entire row before moving to the next
            	one. The way we made this table it will read
            	Teaching...Course Calendar...Research...Data, which makes sense.
            	If we had put the second row of text on a separate row in the
            	table it would read Teaching...Research...Course Calendar...Data,
            	which makes no sense at all. It's easy to make tables which look
            	fine to a sighted reader but are nonsensical when read by a screen
            	reader. On the other hand, it's also easy to 
            	read your table left to right, top to bottom, and make sure that
            	it makes sense when read that way.</p>
<h2><a id="PublishingYourPage" name="PublishingYourPage"></a>Publishing Your Page</h2>
<p>When we defined your web site we gave Dreamweaver two locations:
            	one on the web server, and one in your Windows home directory.
            	When you click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Save</span>, you will be saving the document in
            	your home directory. Before others can see it you need to publish
            	it to the server. To do that, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <span class="InputCode">CTRL-SHIFT-U</span></li>
<li>Click <span class="MenuOutput">Site</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Put</span>  on
            		the menu bar at the top </li>
<li>Right-click on the file in the <span class="MenuOutput">Files</span> panel
            		and choose <span class="MenuOutput">Put</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Since you're working with computers,  nothing is done until it's
            	tested. Start up a web browser and type in <span class="InputCode">www.ssc.wisc.edu/~&lt;your
            	  login name&gt;</span>. You should be able to see your new home
            	  page.  Look it over, try out the links, see if everything works
            	  as you  expected. If not, go back to Dreamweaver and try to
            	  fix it. Make sure you did everything just as described. When
            	  you click on the 
              <span class="MenuOutput">Data</span> link, the browser will probably
              ask you if you want to save the file to disk. That's because unless
              you have Stata, your computer will have no idea what else to do
              with <span class="MenuOutput">data.dta</span>.</p>
<p>An alternative to putting files is to "synchronize" your entire site. Synchronization asks Dreamwever to identify any files which need to be uploaded to the server and do so automatically. You can do this by clicking the two circular arows at the top of the <span class="MenuOutput">Files</span> panel or by clicking <span class="MenuOutput">Site</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Synchronize Sitewide</span>. There's just one catch with synchronization: since Windows and Linux handle time differently, all synchronization information gets scrambled at the begining and end of Daylight Savings Time. The simplest (but slowest) solution is to put your entire site right after the time change, so all the synchronization information is updated. For alternatives see <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/401/kb401070.html">Adobe's TechNote</a> on the issue. Synchronize is mostly useful if you have a large site with lots of non-HTML files like PDFs of papers.</p>
<h2><a id="Templates" name="Templates"></a>Templates</h2>
<p>As you move beyond making a web page and begin to develop a web
            	site, there will probably be things that should be the same on
            	every page. University policy requires you put contact information
            	on every page, you'll almost certainly want a navigation bar,
            	and you probably want to give all your pages a similar layout.
            	Even if you're not concerned about establishing an "identity"
            	for your site, making web web pages is quicker and easier if
            	you reuse components.</p>
<p>Dreamweaver templates allow you to set up a starter page with
            	all the common elements already in place, and then you can
            	simply add in the the table that makes each individual page
            	unique. Even better, if you decide to change the template Dreamweaver
            	will automatically update all the pages based on that template.
            	Consider changing the name of a web page that your navigation
            	bar links to. Without templates, you'd have to change the link
            	in all your pages one by one. With them, you simply
            	change the template  and you're done. Nor are templates limited
            	to navigation bars: the SSCC recently gave our web site a complete
            	graphical makeover but thanks to templates, the task of converting
            	all the individual pages to the new layout took about 15 minutes.</p>
<h3>Creating a Template </h3>
<p>To create a template you start by creating a regular web page--in
            	fact it's quite common to first make a page and then say "I
            	like that--I want all my pages to look like this one." We'll
            	use our sample home page to illustrate. Click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>,
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Save as Template</span>. You'll be given
            	the opportunity to give a description of the template and to
            	name the resulting file something other than <span class="MenuOutput">home</span>,
            	but don't bother. Do allow Dreamweaver to update links.</p>
<p>Several things will happen. First, Dreamweaver will automatically
            	create a folder called <span class="MenuOutput">Templates</span> in
            	the root of your local site. This isn't meant to go on the server
            	or to be visible to anyone but you. Second, the file you have
            	open will now be called <span class="MenuOutput">home.dwt</span> (<span class="MenuOutput">dwt</span> standing
            	for Dreamweaver template) rather
            	than <span class="MenuOutput">home.htm</span>, though <span class="MenuOutput">home.htm</span> is
            	still there on the disk. Third, the file is automatically saved
            	in the <span class="MenuOutput">Templates</span> folder. Templates
            	must be stored in the <span class="MenuOutput">Templates</span> folder
            	or Dreamweaver won't find them. </p>
<p>Next we need to decide what we want to be the same on all our
            	pages, and what we want to be different. Let's leave the title
            	 and the links at the bottom the same, but the part where the
            	table is now will be different. To do that, go ahead and delete
            	the entire table. Then, leaving the cursor there, click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Template
            	Objects</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Editable Region</span>.
            	You'll be asked to give the editable region a name. Type in <span class="InputCode">Content</span>,
            	as this region will contain the actual table of the page.</p>
<p>Templates can contain many editable regions, but one will do for
            	our purposes. Save the template, and then we'll make a page based
            	on it. </p>
<h3>Using a Template </h3>
<p>To create a new page based on a template, click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">New</span>. Then
            	choose the <span class="MenuOutput">Template</span> tab, select the <span class="MenuOutput">home</span> template, and click
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Create</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Selecting the template" height="503" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_15.png" width="600"/></p>
<p>A new page will appear with all the common elements already in
            	place. In fact if you try to change them Dreamweaver won't let
            	you. What you can edit are the editable regions, in our case
            	what's in the <span class="MenuOutput">Content</span> box we just
            	created. Go ahead and put some random text in that box, then
            	save the page as <span class="MenuOutput">templatetest.htm</span>.</p>
<h3>Editing a Template</h3>
<p>You've seen how templates can save you time when you create new
            	pages. Now let's see how they make it easy to change
            	your entire web site. It doesn't make much sense to have all
            	your pages claim to be your home page in the title. So go back
            	to the template (<span class="MenuOutput">home.dwt</span>) and change
            	<span class="MenuOutput">{<span class="Parameter">your name's</span>}
            	Home Page</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">{<span class="Parameter">your
            	name's</span>} Web Site</span>. Now click <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Save</span>.
            	You'll notice it takes a little longer than you might expect.
            	But now switch back to <span class="MenuOutput">templatetest.htm</span>:
            	you'll see that the title has already been changed to match the
            	new template. It would have been just as easy (though it would
            	have taken longer) if you had had a hundred pages in your web
            	site. </p>
<h2><a id="CascadingStyleSheets" name="CascadingStyleSheets"></a>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
<p>The purpose of HTML is to tell the reader's web browser about
            	the structure of your document. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
            	tell the browser what you want it to look like. CSS allows you
            	to define "classes" (or styles) and then apply those styles to
            	pieces of text. Alternatively you can define the way standard HTML
            	tags (<span class="MenuOutput">&lt;h1&gt;</span> for
            	example) are displayed.</p>
<p>There are three places you can put CSS: in an external style sheet
            	which can then be linked to many web pages, at the beginning
            	of a web page so it applies to all of that page, or in an individual
            	tag so it applies to just that tag. The "cascading" part of CSS
            	means that the closest tag will take precedence. If you start
            	using the various tools in Dreamweaver to control appearance
            	Dreamweaver will insert CSS in the page or tag as needed. But we're
            	going to focus on creating an external style sheet which you can
            	use for many pages. That way, like with a template, changes to the
            	style sheet carry over to all the pages in your web site. </p>
<h3>Using a Style Sheet </h3>
<p>We'll start by learning to use styles which have already been
            	defined. Shrink the <span class="MenuOutput">File</span> panel and
            	expand the <span class="MenuOutput">CSS</span> panel by clicking
            	on the small triangles next to their names. Near the bottom of
            	the panel is a small icon of two chain links--click on it to
            	link in an external style sheet. Click Browse and choose <span class="MenuOutput">basic.css</span>,
            	a style sheet with a few basic styles in it.</p>
<p><img alt="Linking an external style sheet" height="211" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_16.png" width="467"/> </p>
<p>You'll see that the CSS panel now has some styles in it. These
            	are the styles defined in <span class="MenuOutput">basic.css</span>, and you can now 
            	use any of them in your page. </p>
<p>As an example, let's put the "boilerplate" contact information
            	line in italics. Select that entire line, then in the <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span>            	panel
            	click on the small triangle by <span class="MenuOutput">Style</span>.
            	This will give you a list of the styles you have available. Choose
            	<span class="MenuOutput">Italic</span>, and the text you selected will be shown in italics.</p>
<p><img alt="Applying a style" height="298" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_17.png" width="337"/> </p>
<p>Now let's put the email address itself in bold. Select the address,
            	then choose <span class="MenuOutput">Bold</span>. Note how the text
            	is both bold and italic: that's because we applied italic to
            	the entire paragraph.</p>
<h3>Creating New Styles</h3>
<p>Now let's create a style of our own. At the bottom of the <span class="MenuOutput">CSS</span>            	panel
            	is a piece of paper with a plus sign over it. This allows you
            	to add new styles to the style sheet. To start with, let's define
            	a style that turns  text red. First click the
            	plus sign. Then set <span class="MenuOutput">Selector Type</span> to Class, and for the name
            	type in <span class="InputCode">red</span>. Make sure <span class="MenuOutput">Define
            	in</span> is set to <span class="MenuOutput">basic.css</span>, so the
            	style goes into the external style sheet rather than just this
            	web page. </p>
<p><img alt="Creating a new class" height="199" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_18.png" width="465"/></p>
<p>By making this a class, we're creating a style which we can apply
            	at will, just like the <span class="MenuOutput">Italic</span> and <span class="MenuOutput">Bold</span> style we've used already.
            	We'll look at the other options shortly.</p>
<p>Click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>, and you'll get to define
            	what this style does. The number of options here is overwhelming,
            	but let's just stick with setting the color for now. Click on
            	the little box next to <span class="MenuOutput">Color</span> and
            	the color selector window will appear. The classic "red" is on
            	the far left side, but I find it's a little light for easy reading
            	and would actually suggest something a bit darker. Whatever you
            	choose, Dreamweaver will automatically translate that into an
            	RGB (Red, Green Blue) code (my slightly darker red is #CC0000).
            	Click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>,
            	and your style is ready for use. Apply it to something to see
            	it in action. </p>
<p><img alt="Defining the red style" height="392" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_19.png" width="540"/> </p>
<p>Up to this point, all the styles we've used have been named
            	for their effect: red, italic, or bold. In practice, I'd suggest
            	creating styles based on what they'll be used for. For example,
            	this document includes one style for <span class="MenuOutput">things
            	that  appear on your screen</span> and another for <span class="InputCode">things
            	that you  type</span>. In a way, you're creating your own structural
            	markup. In your sample home page, you might want
            	to create a style specifically for the contact information line.
            	That way, if you decide that you want that line to be set off
            	by being in a different font rather than by being in italics,
            	you can just change the style without worrying about everything
            	else you've put in italics. </p>
<h3>Changing the Appearance of HTML Tags </h3>
<p>Given that you're going to mark up your web pages with HTML tags
            	anyway, one of the easiest ways to control the appearance of
            	the page is to control what those HTML tags look like. Let's
            	start by changing the title of our page, which is marked as <span class="MenuOutput">&lt;h1&gt;</span> (level
            	one heading). </p>
<p>Click on the plus sign again, but this time set <span class="MenuOutput">Selector
            		Type</span>            	to <span class="MenuOutput">Tag</span>. In <span class="MenuOutput">Tag</span>, type or select <span class="MenuOutput">h1</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="Changing the appearance of &lt;h1&gt;" height="199" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_20.png" width="465"/></p>
<p>We'll be a bit more ambitious this time. Set <span class="MenuOutput">Font</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">Arial,
            		Helvetica, sans-serif</span>. Different browsers running on different
            		computers may have different fonts available, so this means
            		Arial is the first choice, Helvetica is the second, and neither
            		are available then use any generic sans-serif font.</p>
<p> Set <span class="MenuOutput">Size</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">250%</span>.
            	You can set font sizes using points, which is probably more
            	familiar. But if you do, the reader is stuck with your
            	font sizes. If the reader has poor vision, for example, and
            	would like to increase the size of all the text on the page,
            	setting font sizes in points prevents them from doing so.
            	However,  <span class="MenuOutput">250%</span> means "2.5
            	times the size of the default." Thus if the reader increases
            	their default text size, your level one headings will scale
            	accordingly.</p>
<p> Finally, choose a color. But don't click OK yet--we're going
            	to move beyond the <span class="MenuOutput">Type</span> category. </p>
<p><img alt="Type characteristics of &lt;h1&gt;" height="392" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_21.png" width="540"/></p>
<p>Now go to the <span class="MenuOutput">Block</span> category on
            	the left and set <span class="MenuOutput">Text align</span> to <span class="MenuOutput">center</span>.
            	A "block" tag in HTML always comes on its own line. Examples
            	include paragraphs and headings. Certain styles only make sense
            	in the context of a block, including center (what would it mean
            	to center half of a line of text?) and those styles are found
            	in the <span class="MenuOutput">Block</span> category. </p>
<p><img alt="Setting text align to center" height="392" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-17c/5-17_22.png" width="540"/></p>
<p>Click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span> and you'll see that your
            	page title changes immediately. Since it's already marked as a level
            	one heading, the style for level one headings was applied to it
            	automatically.</p>
<p>There are many, many things you can do with CSS. Feel free to
            	just poke around the various categories, try things out, and
            	see how they work. There's just one caveat: some of the more
            	esoteric CSS properties are not supported by all browsers, and
            	some are not supported by any current browser.</p>
<h2><a id="NextSteps" name="NextSteps"></a>Next Steps</h2>
<p>Now that you've got a basic understanding of Dreamweaver and web
            	pages, what should you do next? The first step should probably
            	be to remove the test pages you created from the web server so
            	they aren't available to the world--Google will find them eventually
            	(it's fine to leave them on your local site). Go to the <span class="MenuOutput">File</span> panel,
            	and change  <span class="MenuOutput">Local
            	view</span> in the top right to <span class="MenuOutput">Remote
            	view</span>. You're now looking at what's on the web server. Go
            	ahead and delete all the files.</p>
<p>Next, take a step back and think about your future web site as
            	a whole. What information do you have to share? What categories
            	does that information fall into? Who will be coming to read it?
            	How can you organize it so they can easily find what they need?
            	How many pages will you need? How will they be linked? </p>
<p>Then start thinking about the design of the individual pages.
            	Can they all have the same layout? If you'll be including a navigation
            	bar (and you probably should) where will it be? On the left?
            	At the top and/or bottom? Here's where you may want to look at
            	other pages, especially those with similar goals to yours, and
            	see what you like and don't like about them.</p>
<p>Once you have an idea of the page layout you want, start building
            	a template that implements it. As you do, create a style
            	sheet to give it the look you want. Then, when the template is
            	ready, start making individual pages based on it.</p>
<p>Of course you're not likely to get it exactly right the first
            	time. That's why templates and external style sheets are so useful:
            	as you identify problems with your site design, you can easily
            	go back and make changes to them, and those changes will be applied
            	to the entire site.</p>
<p>If you run into problems, from links that don't work to things
            	that just don't look right, feel free to ask the <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/helpdesk.htm">SSCC
            	Help Desk</a>            	for assistance. We can't make  web pages for
            	you, but we're happy to help you make them work. </p>

<kb_title>Connecting to SSCC Linux Computers using X-Win32</kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>X-Win32 is the SSCC's suggested Linux client for Windows PCs. To install X-Win32,
	first <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/downloads/download-xwin32.php">download
		it</a> from the SSCC web server. You'll need to give your SSCC user name and
		password, as X-Win32 is only licensed for UW faculty, staff, and students.
		Save the file in a convenient location, and then double-click on it.
		It will  install and configure itself. The first time you run X-Win32 you will probably get two messages saying that the Windows Firewall has blocked features of the program. Click <span class="MenuOutput">Allow Access</span> for both of them so that X-Win32 can function properly.</p>
<p><strong>If you are not on the UW-Madison campus you must establish a VPN connection to campus before using X-Win32.</strong> <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/vpn.htm">Connecting to the SSCC Network via VPN</a> has instructions.</p>
<p>To start Linstat after installing X-Win32, simply click the "Linstat" icon in the Start menu. To see all X-Win32 connections and change settings, select X-Win32 19 from the start menu.</p>
<h2><a id="SettingupNewSessions" name="SettingupNewSessions"></a>Setting up New Sessions</h2>
<p>If you need to connect to a particular Linstat server (most likely to monitor a job you started previously—see <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/linstat.htm">Using Linstat</a>) or if you want to connect to some other server, you'll need to set up a new session. This is easy to do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch X-Win32 19 from the Start menu to start the X-Config program. Click the folder named "My Connections" to select it, then click the <strong>Wizard</strong> button under <strong>New Connection</strong> on the right sidebar.
    <p><img alt="" height="742" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin1.png" width="563"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the session a <span class="MenuOutput">Name</span> (for your own purposes—the
      computer doesn't care what it is). Choose <span class="MenuOutput">SSH</span> as
      the <span class="MenuOutput">Type</span>. Then click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="" height="452" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin2.PNG" width="502"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the address of the server you want to connect to and click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>. The four Linstat servers are <span class="InputCode">linstat1.ssc.wisc.edu</span>, <span class="InputCode">linstat2.ssc.wisc.edu</span>, <span class="InputCode">linstat3.ssc.wisc.edu</span>, and <span class="InputCode">linstat4.ssc.wisc.edu</span>.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="452" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin3.PNG" width="502"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type in your username and password. Click <span class="MenuOutput">Next</span>. </p>
<p><img alt="" height="452" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin4.PNG" width="502"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next screen allows you to choose which terminal program to run. Our suggestion is that you use the GNOME Desktop, and that is what the pre-defined sessions use.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="452" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin5.PNG" width="502"/></p>
<p> However, if you prefer xterm, just click on "Linux XTERM" and X-Win32 will enter it for you automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="452" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-2/xwin6.PNG" width="502"/></p>

<kb_title>Cleaning Out Your Email</kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>Whenever you check
		your Inbox for new email or open a mailbox, your email program
		must	go	through all the messages and download at least the message
		headers.	If	you	have
		a large volume of email, this process will be slow--especially on a slow
		Internet connection.	If	it's	too	large,	it	may	fail completely.
		This	also	places	a large	burden	on the email server. Just the
		disk space required has become a problem: the SSCC's email server
		currently stores well over 250 gigabytes of email. Keeping
				your	email	under control will improve the performance of
		both your	email	program	and the	email
server.</p>
<p>The main reasons for keeping email seem to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of time to evaluate and delete messages</li>
<li>Needing it for archival purposes</li>
<li>Needing to keep files attached to email</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no magic solution to any of these, but we do have some suggestions.</p>
<h2>Use Sorting to  Identify Unneeded Email Quickly</h2>
<p>
		Sorting can greatly speed up the process of deciding which emails are
				needed and which can go.	 Sorting
				by date can	help locate the oldest messages,
		which are more likely to be unnecessary. Sorting by size or attachment
		status can quickly locate the largest messages, and deleting a few of
		those	can often
		free a great deal of space. Sorting by subject can put all the related
		messages	together, so you can delete a group of them at once.</p>
<h2>Archiving</h2>
<p>		An email mailbox is merely a single file that contains all the
						body and header information for each message in the mailbox. If your mailbox
						has a
						large number of messages, or very large messages, then
						the file will become quite large as well. Whenever you open the mailbox,
						the computer you are
						using has to have space for the entire file, not just
						the few messages that	you want to look at.</p>
<p>If there are mailboxes or large portions of mailboxes that you just want to
		save but do not refer to on a regular basis, you can simply move them elsewhere.
		You can save mailboxes onto an external storage medium, like a CD. The mailbox
		can be restored as a mailbox by copying it back to the mail directory if you
		need to use it again. </p>
<p>Some email programs, such as Outlook, have an archiving function, and some,
		such as Outlook Express, allow you to export mailboxes. Even without these
		options, moving your archive mailboxes to an external storage device is very
		straightforward. You can find all your mailboxes in the “mail” sub-directory
		of your Linux home directory. Just copy from there to your hard drive to create
		the CD, and then delete the mailbox, either within or outside of the email
		program.</p>
<p>Another space-saver to consider with either your archived mailboxes or your
		attachments is file compression. If you zip your files, they will take up less
		space, whether it’s on a CD or on a computer or server. You can also
		use this to organize your attachments, putting related files into the same
compressed archive.</p>
<h2>Saving Attachments</h2>
<p>		Attachments account for nearly all of the really large email messages.
				Sometimes the email message itself is not very important, and
				what really	matters is the attachment. If that’s why you’re saving
				an email message, consider saving the attachment as a regular
				file independent	of the	message. You	may need
				to create some subdirectory structure within your disk space
				that	will help you find the file easily, but that’s a one-time job
				that	may be worth the effort.</p>
<p>		In Outlook Express, there are 2 methods. One option is to use the <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>  menu.</p>

<p><br/>
<img alt="Choose the attachment to save" height="301" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-22/5-22_2.png" width="450"/></p>
<p>Select which attachments you want to save and click <span class="MenuOutput">Browse</span>.</p>
<p><br/>
<img alt="Choose a folder to save the attachment in" height="482" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-22/5-22_3.png" width="672"/><br/>
</p>
<p>Specify the folder that the saved attachments should go to, click	<span class="MenuOutput">Ok</span>,
and	then <span class="MenuOutput">Save</span>.</p>
<p>		Alternatively, you can just drag the attachment directly from the message
		to a folder.</p>
<p>Once the attachment is saved, there’s no need to keep the email message.
		The flip-side of this is that your email program may save a second copy
		of	your
		attachments on your local hard drive, and does not delete them
		even	after	the	email	message	has	been	deleted.	It’s
		worth checking	the directory that is designated for attachments to see
		if everything in it is really necessary. In Eudora, you can find that
		directory	in
		the <span class="MenuOutput">Tools</span>, 
		<span class="MenuOutput">Options</span> menu, under <span class="MenuOutput">Attachments</span>. Note that checking <span class="MenuOutput">Delete
attachments	when emptying Trash</span> does not work with an IMAP mail server
like ours.</p>
<p><br/>
<img alt="Finding your attachments folder" height="391" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-22/5-22_4.png" width="414"/></p>
<p>In Outlook Express, the attachment is not automatically downloaded until you
		open it, and then it is placed in the <span class="MenuOutput">My Documents</span> folder associated
		with your username, usually on the C: drive. On the terminal servers,
		this	folder is
		part of your profile and must be downloaded every time you log in – the
more you store there, the longer it takes to log in and out.</p>

<kb_title>Setting Up Network Printers in Windows</kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>The SSCC provides network printers accessible to all SSCC members in 4218, 3218 and 2470 Sewell
	 Social Sciences Building. Note that to pick up your print jobs from 4218 or 3218 after <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/instruction/labusers.htm">hours</a> or from 2470 at any time, you will need <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc_jsp/account/lab.jsp">after-hours access to the SSCC computer labs</a>.</p>
<p>If you are not plugged into the wired network in the Sewell Social Science Building, you first need to establish a <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/vpn.htm">VPN connection</a> to the SSCC network before connecting to SSCC printers.</p>
<h2>Adding a Printer</h2>
<p>Click the Start (or  Windows logo) button and then type <span class="InputCode">\\print</span> in the <span class="MenuOutput">Search programs and files</span> (or just <span class="MenuOutput">Run</span>) box.</p>
<p><img alt="Connecting to print" height="206" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-24b/5-24_image1.PNG" width="399"/></p>
<p>This will open a window showing all the printers on print, the SSCC's print server.</p>
<p><img alt="Printer list" height="609" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-24b/5-24_image2.PNG" width="577"/></p>
<p> Most of these are for particular departments or groups. The  printers available to all SSCC members are:</p>
<table align="center" border="1" cellpadding="3" width="50%">
<caption align="top">
<a id="Names" name="Names"></a>SSCC Printer Network Names
  </caption>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Room</th>

<td align="center" class="MenuOutput">SSCC3218</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">2470</td>
<td align="center" class="MenuOutput">SSCC2470</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Each room has several physical printers, but when you submit a job to that room's virtual printer it will be printed on the first available physical printer.</p>
<p>To connect to a printer, simply double-click on it. A window will open showing the printer's current queue. You can close this window and the printer will still be available when you go to print.</p>
<p>If you are printing JSTOR articles or other large PDF files, please use the 4218 printers. These printers have the least problems with 
  complex PDF files. In addition, they are our fastest printers and this will 
  significantly reduce the amount of time others may have to wait while your job 
  is printing.</p>
<h2>Setting Your Default Printer</h2>
<p>To set your default printer, click <span class="MenuOutput">Start</span> (or the Windows logo button), <span class="MenuOutput"> Devices and Printers</span> (or some variation on that depending on the version of Windows you're using). Alternatively, hold down the Windows logo key on your keyboard and press <span class="InputCode">r</span>, then type <span class="InputCode">control printers</span> in the box.</p>
<p>You'll then get a list of printers that have been set up on your computer.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="541" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-24b/win10_setdefault_new.PNG" width="617"/></p>
<p>The one with the small checkmark on it is your current default printer. To make a different printer the default, right-click on it and select <span class="MenuOutput">Set as Default Printer</span>.</p>
<p>Note that if you log in to Winstat from your computer, the Citrix Receiver will make your default printer available from within your Winstat session. Be sure your default printer is the one you want to use before you log in.</p>

<p>(Mac users should read <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/diskfrommac.htm">Using SSCC Network  Disk Space from Macs</a> instead of this article.)</p>
<p>In Windows networks, network disk space is organized into "shares." 
  Mapping a drive allows you to use one of these shares as if it were a local
  hard drive. If you are logging into the PRIMO domain, most of the shares
  you might want to use are mapped automatically. However, there are some situations
  where you might want to map a drive to a network share yourself. If you are
  connecting to the SSCC network from home using <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/vpn.htm">VPN</a> the usual shares are available
  but not mapped automatically. Also, there are some Linux shares you might need at some point which are not mapped
  for you.</p>
<p>This article will show you both how to map a drive to a network share,
	and tell you some of the shares you might want to map.</p>
<h2><a id="MappingaDrive" name="MappingaDrive"></a>Mapping a Drive</h2>

<li>If you are not logging in from a PC in the SSCC's PRIMO domain, check <span class="MenuOutput">Connect using different credentials</span>.

<!-- #BeginEditable "Text" -->
<p>After all the work of writing your dissertation, there's one last hurdle.
		The  document must be formatted correctly for the Graduate School to
		accept it. 
  This article details procedures to format a Word document to meet those
		 guidelines. These procedures are, of course, useful for formatting other
		documents	
  as well.</p>
<p>The Graduate School makes its dissertation format guidelines available online
		 at <a href="http://info.gradsch.wisc.edu/admin/academicservices/pguide.html">http://info.gradsch.wisc.edu/admin/academicservices/pguide.html</a>.
		  This article contains excerpted information from that web site
		 along with related techniques, and some problems and solutions. It is
		 not intended to replace the guidelines themselves; it is simply a guide
		 to implementing some of them in Word.</p>
<h3>Appendices</h3>
<p>You may put unusual or supplementary materials (such as questionnaires or copies 
  of photographs) into appendices. Number the appendices consecutively with the 
  text of the dissertation. The margins of the appendices must meet the standards 
  for the rest of the dissertation.</p>
<p>You may want to make each appendix or the collection of appendices into a
		separate  section or even a separate file. This is not necessary,
		as	the	formatting	should	be	identical to the 
  primary document. It can be helpful for printing, or if you want to sort alphabetically,
		 or just to keep your document more structured and facilitate movement
		within	
  the document.</p>
<p>To add a section break: </p>
<ul>
<li>Go to<span class="MenuOutput"> Insert</span>, then select <span class="MenuOutput">Break</span>. 
  </li><li>
  In the Break menu, you will probably want to go with <span class="MenuOutput">Next 
  Page</span> - the default. This will help you ensure that your appendices each 
  start on a new page.</li></ul>
<h3>Bibliography </h3>
<p>The bibliography should meet your major department's style requirements, which
		 often conform to the leading journals or book series of the field. It
		may  be single-spaced with an additional space between entries.</p>
<p>To set line spacing:</p>
<ul><li>
  Go to the <span class="MenuOutput">Format</span> menu.</li>
<li>Select<span class="MenuOutput"> Paragraph</span>, and select the <span class="MenuOutput">Indents 
  and Spacing</span> tab.</li></ul>
<h3>Equations, Superscripts, and Subscripts</h3>
<p>Equations, superscripts, and subscripts are acceptable provided they are legible 
  when microfilmed. Generally, superscripts and subscripts may be one size smaller 
  than the text. To identify each equation clearly, please isolate it with double 
  spacing.</p>
<p>To insert a subscript or superscript:</p>
<ul><li>  Select the text you want to format as superscript or subscript.</li>
<li>  On the <span class="MenuOutput">Format</span> menu, click <span class="MenuOutput">Font</span>, 
  and then click the<span class="MenuOutput"> Font</span> tab.</li>
<li>  Select the <span class="MenuOutput">Superscript</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Subscript</span> 
  check box.</li></ul>
<p>To insert an equation:</p>
<ul><li>  Click where you want to insert the equation.</li>
<li>On the <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span> menu, click <span class="MenuOutput">Object</span>, 
  and then click the <span class="MenuOutput">Create New</span> tab.</li>
<li>In the <span class="MenuOutput">Object</span> type box, click <span class="MenuOutput">Microsoft 
  Equation 3.0</span>.</li>
<li>Click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>.</li>
<li>Build the equation by selecting symbols from the Equation toolbar and by typing 
  variables and numbers.</li>
<li>To return to Microsoft Word, click the Word document.</li></ul>
<p>From the top row of the Equation toolbar, you can choose mathematical symbols. 
  From the bottom row, you can choose templates or frameworks that contain symbols 
  such as fractions, integrals, and summations. </p>
<p><span class="italic">Problem</span>: You have created an equation with the
		 Equation Editor in Word 2000. Once you exit from the editor you can
		no longer	
edit the equation.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Solution</span>: In order to re-open the Equation
        				Editor to edit an equation you have previously created,
        		all you need to do is click
  				on the equation, so that the rectangle containing it is highlighted.
			Then, right-click to get a menu of choices. </p>
<h3>
  Footnotes and Endnotes</h3>
<p>  Footnotes and endnotes may be single-spaced with an extra space
						between notes. Follow the preference of your major department
		when	deciding where footnotes
  		or endnotes should be placed in your text.</p>
<p>To insert a footnote:</p>
<ul>
<li>  In <span class="MenuOutput">Print Layout</span> view, click where you want to insert the note reference
  		mark. 
  </li>
<li>  Click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Reference</span>,
  		and <span class="MenuOutput">Footnote</span>. Click <span class="MenuOutput">Footnotes</span>  or <span class="MenuOutput">Endnotes</span>.
  		By default, Word places footnotes at the end of each page and endnotes
  		at the end of the document. You can change the placement of footnotes
  		and	endnotes  using the menus next to <span class="MenuOutput">Footnotes</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Endnotes</span>.</li>
<li>
  In the <span class="MenuOutput">Number format</span> box, click the format you want. </li>
<li>
  Click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>. Word inserts the note number and places the insertion point next 
  to the note number. </li>
<li>
  Type the note text. </li>
<li>
  Scroll to your place in the document, click where you want the cursor to be,
  		and	continue	typing. </li>
<li>
  Note that as you insert additional footnotes or endnotes in the document, Word 
  automatically applies the correct number format. </li>
<li>
  There are also shortcut keys available to insert subsequent footnotes. Press
  		 <span class="InputCode">Ctrl-Alt-f</span> to insert a footnote. Press <span class="InputCode">Ctrl-Alt-d</span> to insert an endnote.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you add, delete, or move notes that are automatically numbered, Word renumbers 
  the footnote and endnote reference marks.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You have a paper for a journal that requires the footnotes be endnotes. 
  But you want the endnotes to come before your references and such. One option 
  would be to put the references in a separate file, but is there a way to do 
this and leave it all in one file?</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: When you are setting up endnotes, you can select whether
		you want to put them at the end of the document or at the end of the section.
		You can
  place a section break before your references, and select "end of section", 
and your endnotes will follow the text, but precede the reference section. </p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You have a Word document with footnotes. Someone (maybe you) was working 
  on it, using WordPerfect. The conversion back and forth messed up the footnote 
format.</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: The two formats are  not quite compatible. To
		repair, the easiest way is to work with each footnote individually. Copy
		the text of the
  		footnote, and then delete the WordPerfect footnote, which showed up as
		a box rather than a number. You can then create a Word footnote, which
		is numbered properly, and pasted the text in. This works,
		and keeps	the number
		sequence intact. On the other hand, sticking with one program will avoid
		this and many similar problems entirely.</p>
<h3>  Foreign Language Use</h3>
<p> You may include quotations in languages other than English in your dissertation.
  				However, the dissertation itself must be in English unless your
		department certifies
  		that one or both of the following conditions have been met: the foreign
		language is that of the readers to whom the work is addressed; or translation
		into
  				English
  		would make the study obscure and imprecise. </p>
<p>Note that some foreign language fonts and spell-checking are available on
		the  Winstat servers.</p>
<h3>  Graphics</h3>
<p>  Computer generated figures and graphs must meet the same standards
						as the rest of the dissertation. Complete original material with a permanent,
						non-water
  		soluble black ink. Do not use pencils, ball point, or felt tip pens.
						Labels on photographs, charts, or other figures must be permanent. Headings,
						keys,
  		and all other identifying information must be of the same quality of
						print as the text. If graphics, tables, or figures are in landscape mode,
						place the top
  		of the printed page at the dissertation binding edge (left side of the
						paper) with the page number in the upper right-hand corner in the portrait
						page setup.</p>
<p>To insert an image, you really only need to know the name and location of
the  image file:</p>
<ul><li>Within the document, place the cursor where you want the image
						to be inserted. Go to the <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span> menu, and select <span class="MenuOutput">Picture</span>, and then <span class="MenuOutput">From
						File</span>.</li>
<li>
  Select the image.	It will be inserted into the document.</li>
<li>
  You can use the <span class="MenuOutput">Picture or Drawing</span> toolbars to manipulate it. The Word
  		<span class="MenuOutput">Help</span>	menu has step-by-step instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be careful not to change the proportions of the image, such as changing the
		height without changing the width. This is especially important with
		graphs.</p>
<h3>
Margins</h3>
<p> Use a minimum of 1" margin on all four sides. To set margins:</p>
<ul><li>Click on <span class="MenuOutput">File</span>.</li>
<li>  Click on <span class="MenuOutput">Page Setup</span>.</li>
<li>
  Click on the <span class="MenuOutput">Margins</span> tab, and edit the settings for the left, right, top and 
  bottom margins.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Page Numbers</h3>
<p>Page numbers are required and must be placed in the upper right-hand
		corner one inch from both the top and the side of the paper. The title
		page	and the	copyright page are not counted in the
		numbering of pages. All other pages are. </p>
<p>Number the preliminary pages (for example, dedication page, acknowledgments
		page, table of tables, and abstract) that precede the main text with
		lower	case Roman numerals beginning with i. Number the main text consecutively
		beginning with Arabic numeral 1 in the upper right-hand corner one inch
		from	both top and side of the paper. Check
		your dissertation	to ensure that all pages are present and in numerical
		order. Number appendices consecutively with the text, continuing the
		Arabic	numeral	sequence.</p>
<p>To insert page numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>		Click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Page
						Numbers</span>. </li>
<li>
		In the <span class="MenuOutput">Position</span> box, specify whether to print page numbers in
				the header	at	the top of the page or in the footer at the bottom of the page.</li>
<li>
		In the <span class="MenuOutput">Alignment</span> box, specify whether to align page numbers left,
				center, or right relative to the left and right margins, or inside or outside
				relative
				to the inside and outside edges of pages that will be bound.</li>
<li>
		If you don't want a number on the first page, uncheck <span class="MenuOutput">Show
				number on	first	page</span>.</li>
<li>
		Select any other options you want. </li></ul>
<p>Putting each chapter of your dissertation in a separate file is a very good
		idea, but you'll need to set the starting page number for the later chapters:</p>
<ul>
<li> Click <span class="MenuOutput">Insert</span>,  <span class="MenuOutput">Page
		Numbers</span>.</li>
<li>   				 Click <span class="MenuOutput">Format</span>.</li>
<li>   				 At the bottom, under <span class="MenuOutput">Page Numbering</span>, select <span class="MenuOutput">Start
        		At</span>.</li>
<li> Type in the page number for the first page.</li>
</ul>
<p>To move page numbers:</p>
<ul><li>On the <span class="MenuOutput">View</span> menu, click <span class="MenuOutput">Header
						and Footer</span>.</li>
<li>
  If you positioned the page numbers at the bottom of the page,
				click <span class="MenuOutput">Switch Between	Header and Footer</span> on the <span class="MenuOutput">Header
				and Footer</span> toolbar.</li>
<li>  Click the page number to make its frame appear.</li>
<li>Click on the frame to select it.</li>
<li>
  Move the pointer over the frame's border until the pointer becomes a
  		four-headed	arrow, and then click to see the frame's sizing handles.</li>
<li>
  Drag the frame and page number to a new location.</li>
</ul>
<p>To rotate the page numbers for pages that are printed in landscape format:</p>
<ul>
<li> Select the object you want to rotate.</li>
<li>
  Click <span class="MenuOutput">Draw</span> on the Drawing
toolbar.</li>
<li>
  Point to <span class="MenuOutput">Rotate</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Flip.</span></li>
<li>
  Click <span class="MenuOutput">Rotate Left</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Rotate
  Right</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>  Do not number the title page. The title page must be double-spaced.</p>
<h3>Page Headers</h3>
<p>
  Do not use page headers (except for page numbers) or decorative borders.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: I am trying to stop the header from appearing on the first
		page. I
only want it on the subsequent pages.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You can leave the header or footer off the first page
						or create a unique first page header or footer for the first page in a
						document or the first
  		page of each section within a document.</p>
<ul><li>  If your document is divided into sections, click in a section
						or select multiple sections you want to change. Click anywhere in the document
						if your
  				document
  				is not divided into sections. </li><li>
  On the <span class="MenuOutput">View</span> menu, click <span class="MenuOutput">Header
  and Footer</span>.</li>
<li>
  On the <span class="MenuOutput">Header and Footer</span> toolbar, click <span class="MenuOutput">Page
  Setup</span>.</li>
<li>
  Click the <span class="MenuOutput">Layout</span> tab.</li>
<li>
  Select the <span class="MenuOutput">Different first page</span> check box, and then click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>.</li>
<li>
  If necessary, click S<span class="MenuOutput">how Previous</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Show
  Next</span> on the <span class="MenuOutput">Header
  				and Footer</span> toolbar to move into the <span class="MenuOutput">First
  				Page Header</span> area or <span class="MenuOutput">First Page
  				Footer</span> area.</li>
<li>
  Create the header or footer for the first page of the document
  				or section.</li><li>
  If you don't want a header or footer on the first page, leave
  				the header	and	footer areas blank.</li></ul>
<h2>General Formatting Problems</h2>
<p> <em>Problem</em>: You have a Word document and want to get rid of the
				formatting.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You can highlight the entire document (press <span class="InputCode">Ctrl-a</span>),
		copy	it,	then	open	a new document and go to <span class="MenuOutput">Edit</span>,<span class="MenuOutput"> </span> <span class="MenuOutput">Paste
						Special</span>, choose <span class="MenuOutput">Unformatted Text</span> and
						click <span class="MenuOutput">OK</span>.
						This	is	a drastic solution, to be used when there
						are	too	many format	settings	scattered	throughout
						the document to just find and remove them.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You want to change the font in an entire Word document.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You can select all (<span class="InputCode">Ctrl-a</span>)
		and then go to font and size, to change the font for the whole document. </p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You want to get rid of odd indents that are left over from previous 
  formatting.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: Just use the <span class="InputCode">Backspace</span> key,
		and then <span class="InputCode">Tab</span> to get proper	indents.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: The font changed in mid-document. How did it happen and how can you 
  fix it?</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: This is usually leftover information from something that
		had probably been inserted and then deleted, but the formatting information
		remained.
				You
  can use <span class="MenuOutput">What's This?</span> from the <span class="MenuOutput">Help</span> menu
  to find the problem area,  and then just change the formatting in that area.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You don't want section breaks in your document. How can
		you get rid of them? Where did they come from in the first place?</p>
<p><em>Solution</em>: Word does not insert section breaks automatically--this
		usually comes up when more than one person works on a document. Sections
		can be useful when large
						formatting changes
  		are made, e.g. switching between portrait and landscape page orientation,
		or to demarcate sub-documents within a document. To remove section breaks,
		select the section break and then either press
        <span class="InputCode">Delete</span> or click <span class="MenuOutput">Edit</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Cut</span>.
        Note that you cannot delete a section break just by backspacing over
        it. The <span class="InputCode">Backspace</span> and <span class="InputCode">Delete</span> keys
        don't affect section breaks unless you select them specifically.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You have a page break that you don't want in your document.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You should be able to just delete this using the <span class="InputCode">Delete</span>  or <span class="InputCode">Backspace</span> key.
		This may leave you with some formatting problems, though,	which you can
  		find and correct using <span class="MenuOutput">What's This?</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">Reveal
  		Formatting</span>.</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: How can you keep text from being split up across pages?</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You simply highlight the whole area, and choose <span class="MenuOutput">Format</span>,
		<span class="MenuOutput">Paragraph</span>, choose the <span class="MenuOutput">Line
		and Page Breaks</span>  tab,	and	check	<span class="MenuOutput">Keep	lines
		together</span>.
  Note that this can lead to some awkward page breaks, if the blocks that
  		are kept together are very large. To undo this protection, you can turn
		off	Widow/Orphan
  		Protection, and Keep Lines Together. [both? not just undo what you just
		did?]</p>
<p><em>Problem</em>: You and your advisor are both editing the document and you want to 
  be able to see your advisor's suggestions without necessarily accepting them.</p>
<p> <em>Solution</em>: You can both use the features found on the <span class="MenuOutput">Review</span> toolbar.
						These include	comments and tracking changes.</p>
<h3>Useful Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make each chapter a separate Word document.
				This will make it quicker to open and save, easier to work with,
		and minimize	the impact of mistakes.</li>
<li>Use section breaks to separate different parts of your dissertation, 
  				to change orientation of pages, or to insert endnotes in a particular
				place.</li>
<li>
You can see the formatting codes for the document by going to <span class="MenuOutput">Format</span>	and choosing <span class="MenuOutput">Reveal
Formatting</span>. Here you can easily see the settings,
and make 	changes as needed. (Office XP only)</li>
<li>
 You can also get information about the formatting codes at any particular 
  				point in the document by going to <span class="MenuOutput">Help</span> and choosing <span class="MenuOutput">What's
		This?</span>	Click the cursor	in your text to see the format settings at that point.</li>
<li>
 Use the Microsoft Office Help to learn how to handle tasks in Word. Help 
  				is very good and detailed, and can answer most questions.</li>
<li>
 When one part of the document is doing exactly what you want, and another 
  				part isn't, sometimes the easiest way is to cut the text from
 		the "bad" 
  part and paste it into the "good" part.</li>
<li>
 Stick with one word-processing program for the entire document, and the 
  				entire writing process.</li>
</ul>

<kb_title>Removing Hidden Data from Documents </kb_title>
<kb_keywords>.</kb_keywords>
<kb_summary>.</kb_summary>
<kb_body>

<!-- InstanceBeginEditable name="Text" -->
<p>Sending and publishing documents  electronically is commonplace.
              Unlike the paper version though where "what you see is what you
              get", electronic documents contain  hidden
              data or metadata. Whenever you create, open, or save a document
              in a program like Word or WordPerfect, metadata is written to the
              document. </p>
<p>Sometimes this metadata is not information you want to share with
              others though. For example, your name is metadata.
              If you are doing a "blind" review of a paper for publication
              or submitting a document anonymously, you certainly do not want
              your name included in your document. This article tells
              you the kinds of metadata stored in documents generated by Microsoft
              Word, Corel WordPerfect, and Adobe Acrobat, and how to remove the
              metadata. </p>
<h2>Types of Metadata  </h2>
<p>The metadata stored varies from program to program. Programs like
              Word and WordPerfect store a lot of metadata and may include your
              name, your initials, your organization name, your user name, your
              computer's name, the network server's name or hard disk where you
              saved the document, the names of previous document
              authors, document revisions including undo/redo history, reviewers'
              annotations, document creation and revision dates, template information,
              hidden text, and comments, among other things. </p>
<p>Many people distribute documents in PDF format as a way to avoid
              sending metadata. This works for the most part but even PDF files
              may contain metadata like title, subject, author, key fields,
              and annotations. Unlike with Word and WordPerfect though, metadata
              gets stored in PDF files because someone puts it there. </p>
<p>People distributing very sensitive information may resort to sending
              only text versions of files.  This way they are assured that there
              is no hidden data contained in the file. </p>
<h2>Removing Metadata </h2>
<p>Tools for removing metadata vary from version to version of the
              programs. In general, newer versions of programs make it easier
              to remove metadata than in older versions. Below are links to directions
              for removing metadata from commonly used versions of Word, WordPerfect,
              and Acrobat:</p>

            for removing metadata.) </p>

<p>SecureFX is a Windows SFTP client. FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, 
              has been moving files from computer to computer since the earliest 
              days of the Internet. To cope with today's more dangerous Internet, 
              FTP has added encryption, becoming Secure FTP or SFTP. SFTP clients, 
              like SecureFX, give you a drag-and-drop interface and then translate 
              your actions into SFTP commands for you.</p>
<p>SSCC members have several good alternatives for transferring files
            	 to and from the SSCC network. <a href="http://wi.ssc.wisc.edu">Logging
            	 in to Winstat </a>  allows
            	 you to see both the network drives and your local  hard drive
            	 from within a terminal server session, and you can move files
            	 back and forth just by dragging them. <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/vpn.htm">Virtual
            	  Private Networking</a> or VPN allows your computer to log in to
               the PRIMO domain, gaining access to network drives just as if
              you  were in the Social Science building. SecureFX usually takes
              less  time to set up than the other options, but it does require
              that  you open it every time you want to transfer a file rather
              than having  everything available through network drives. All three
              solutions  work well and it's really a matter of preference.</p>
<p>SecureFX can be downloaded from the <a href="https://software.wisc.edu">Campus Software Library</a> or from <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/softwarecenter.htm">Software Center</a>. Be sure to get SecureFX and not SecureCRT. The default choices in the installation
            		  program  are fine. If you use SecureCRT to log in to the
            		  SSCC's Linux servers, you'll see that SecureFX and SecureCRT
            		  are tightly integrated, sharing server lists and other settings
            		  and having much of their user interface in common. The disadvantage
            		  to this approach is that you'll see buttons and options which
            		  are only relevant to SecureCRT while using SecureFX.</p>
<p>SSCC members who are not affiliated with UW-Madison cannot use SecureFX due to license restrictions, but can use free clients FTP like <a href="https://winscp.net/eng/download.php">WinSCP</a> and <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a>. The information needed to set up connections is the same regardless of the client you use.</p>
<p>If you're interested in using SFTP on Linux, or if you want to 
              use anonymous FTP to make files available or let people send you 
              files, see <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/1-11.htm">Using SFTP</a>.</p>
<h2> Setting up Connections            </h2>
<p>When you first start SecureFX, you'll get the <span class="MenuOutput">Connections</span> 
              window (if you don't, click the far left button on the tool bar). 
              This is where you'll set up connections to the servers you want 
              to use. To create a new connection, click <span class="MenuOutput">Quick 
              Connect</span>, the button with the lightning bolt.</p>
<p> Note that the button next to it, <span class="MenuOutput">New 
              Session</span>, is for SecureCRT and cannot be used to set up SFTP 
              connections. Similarly, you'll see any sessions you have defined 
              in SecureCRT, but if you select them the <span class="MenuOutput">Connect</span> 
              button will be unavailable.</p>
<p><img alt="Connect Window" height="349" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-35/5-35_1.png" width="345"/></p>
<p>You'll then see the Quick Connect window. Set <span class="MenuOutput">Protocol</span> 
              to <span class="MenuOutput">SFTP</span>. In <span class="MenuOutput">Hostname</span>, 
              type the name of the server you want to connect to. The SSCC's FTP 
              servers are <span class="InputCode">ftp.ssc.wisc.edu</span> for 
              files stored on the Linux file system and <span class="InputCode">ntftp.ssc.wisc.edu</span> 
              for files stored on the Windows file system. Make sure <span class="MenuOutput">Port</span> 
              is set to <span class="InputCode">22</span> (<em><strong>not</strong></em> 
              23). Enter your <span class="MenuOutput">Username</span> if you 
              like, or you can enter it when you connect. Check <span class="MenuOutput">Save 
              session</span>. When you're ready, click <span class="MenuOutput">Connect</span>. 
              You'll be connected with the server immediately, and these settings 
              will also be saved so you won't have to enter them again later.</p>
<p><img alt="Quick Connect Window" height="368" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-35/5-35_2.png" width="396"/></p>
<p>Note that the first time you connect with a new server you'll see 
              a message saying that the program does not yet have an entry for 
              that host and it needs to save the encryption key. Click <span class="MenuOutput">Accept 
              &amp; Save</span> and that message will not return.</p>
<h2>Using SecureFX</h2>
<p>Once you're connected to the server you'll see two windows. You 
              can arrange them however you like (the arrangement in the picture 
              below was obtained by clicking <span class="MenuOutput">Window</span>, 
              <span class="MenuOutput">Tile Vertically</span>).</p>
<p><img alt="The main window after connecting to a server" height="483" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/5-35/5-35_3.png" width="642"/></p>
<p>One window is for the server you've connected to (in this case, 
              <span class="MenuOutput">ftp.ssc.wisc.edu</span>). The left side 
              of the window shows directories and the right side shows files. 
              The bottom shows the actual FTP commands sent to the server and 
              the server's responses. These can be ignored if everything is working 
              well, but if you run into trouble they may provide valuable information. 
              You'll start in your home directory; you can easily move to any 
              directory on the server.</p>
<p>The other window is for your local computer (in this case <span class="MenuOutput">RUBY</span>). 
              Again, the left side shows drives or directories and the right side 
              shows files.</p>
<p>Once you've located the file you want to move and the directory 
              where you want it to be, simply drag it from one window to the other. 
              SecureFX will send the proper FTP commands to the server to make 
              it happen.</p>
