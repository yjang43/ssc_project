<h2><a id="WindowsandLinux" name="WindowsandLinux"></a>Windows, Linux, and Silo</h2>
<p>The SSCC has two parallel file systems: one for Windows and one
          		for Linux. Thus you have two home directories, there are two
          		project directories, etc. A program called Samba makes the Linux
          		file system available to Windows, but not the other way around.
          		This can be a big help to Windows users who are learning Linux,
          		but if you're only using Windows programs Windows disk space
          		will give slightly better performance.</p>
<p>The Silo environment has a separate secure file system. It is Linux-based system, and thus has only Z: and V: drives, not U: and X:. It also has an S: drive, or <span class="InputCode">/smph</span>, containing project directories for SMPH researchers.</p>
<h2><a id="PrivateSpace" name="PrivateSpace"></a>Private Space</h2>
<p>Private disk space is provided in "home directories."
          		In Windows, your home directory is the <span class="MenuOutput">U:</span> drive.
          		In Linux your home directory is ~, or <span class="InputCode">/home/{<span class="Parameter">first
          		letter of your user name</span>}/{<span class="Parameter">your user
          		name</span>}</span> (e.g. <span class="InputCode">/home/r/rdimond</span>).
          		 You can access your Linux home directory
          		from Windows as the <span class="MenuOutput">Z:</span>          		drive.</p>
<p>Each home directory starts with 20 gigabytes of space. If you
          		need more space, we will increase either quota (or both) to 40 gigabytes
          		on request.   If you need more than this, consider
          		requesting a project directory. You can <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc_jsp/account/space/">request
          		additional space</a> in your home directory by filling out a web
          		form. To check how much space you're using in Windows right-click
          		on your <span class="MenuOutput">U:</span> drive and choose <span class="MenuOutput">Properties</span>; in Linux type <span class="InputCode">quota</span>. </p>
<p>Home directories are private: other SSCC users cannot access files
          		in your home directory. </p>
<h2><a id="ProjectSpace" name="ProjectSpace"></a>Project Space</h2>
<p>Project space is mainly for groups working together on a common
          		project, though if you need more space than can be provided in
          		your home directory it's possible to request a project directory
          		for one person. Project directories can be as large as needed,
          		but keep in mind that disk space is costly (see <a href="#ManagingyourSpace">Managing
          		your Space</a>).</p>
<p>Windows project folders can be found on the <span class="MenuOutput">X:</span> drive.
          		Linux project directories can be found under <span class="InputCode">/project</span>.
          		Linux project directories are available from Windows on the <span class="MenuOutput">V:</span>          		drive. SMPH projects in Silo are found under <span class="InputCode">/smph</span>, available from Windows as the <span class="MenuOutput">S:</span> drive.</p>
<p>Each project directory has an associated group of users who can
          		access the directory. Other users cannot. If you need access
          		to a particular project directory, the owner of that directory
          		must <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/helpdesk.htm">contact the SSCC Help Desk</a> and
          		ask that you be added to the group.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc_jsp/account/project/">request a project directory</a> by filling out a web form.</p>
<p>Normally project directories should be created in the same operating
          		system (Windows or Linux) as the programs you'll be using. However,
          		if you'll be using both Windows and Linux programs the directory
          		should be created in Linux.</p>
<h2><a id="TemporarySpace" name="TemporarySpace"></a>Temporary Space</h2>
<p>Both Windows and Linux have space where you can store
          		 files temporarily. Files placed in these spaces will be deleted after 30 days.</p>
<p>In Windows, temporary space is available on the <span class="MenuOutput">Y:</span> (Temp30days)
          		drive.
          		If you wish to use it, make a folder for your files (e.g. <span class="InputCode">Y:\rdimond</span>). The <span class="MenuOutput">Y:</span> drive is completely public:
          		any SSCC user can read, change, or delete any file on the <span class="MenuOutput">Y:</span> drive.
          		This makes it a convenient place for sharing files with others,
          		however, it should never be used for confidential data (or for
          		any serious research data, really).</p>
<p>In Linux, temporary space is available in <span class="InputCode">/temp30days</span>.
          		If you wish to  use it, make a subdirectory for your files
          		 (e.g. <span class="InputCode">/temp30days/rdimond</span>).
          		Directories under <span class="InputCode">/temp30days</span> are private by default, but if you're familiar with setting Linux permissions you can make them public if you so desire.</p>
<p>If you need to access the Linux temporary space from Windows, you'll
          		need to <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/5-26.htm">map a drive</a> to it. </p>
<p>Note that <strong>temporary space is not backed up</strong> in
          		either Linux or Windows. <strong>Temporary space is not intended for
          		long-term storage of important files.</strong></p>
<h2><a id="BackupsandRestores" name="BackupsandRestores"></a>Backups and Restores</h2>
<p>Home  and project directories, and system directories such
          		as web sites, are backed up  three times a day: see the <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/policies/backup.htm">SSCC
          		Data Integrity Policy</a> for details. Files on local hard drives (<span class="MenuOutput">C:</span> or <span class="MenuOutput">D:</span>)
          		are not backed up. We  hate to see anyone lose data, so
          		please <strong>store all important files on the network
          		where they are backed up</strong>.</p>
<p>If you need a file restored,   <a href="mailto:helpdesk@ssc.wisc.edu">send
          			the Help Desk an email</a> with the following information: </p>
<ul>
<li>The operating system the file was stored on (Windows or Linux) </li>
<li>The name of the file</li>
<li>The full location of the file (e.g. <span class="InputCode">U:\dissertation\absolutely
          			critical data</span> or <span class="InputCode">~/dissertation/absolutelyCriticalData</span>)</li>
<li>The date as of which you want it recovered (e.g. "the most recent
          			backup") </li>
</ul>
<p>If the file has been deleted and you don't know some of this
          		information, just do your best and we can usually find it.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that restoring files from backup takes a significant
          		amount of staff time. </p>
<h2><a id="ManagingyourSpace" name="ManagingyourSpace"></a>Managing your Space</h2>
<p>The SSCC uses Storage Attached Network (SAN) devices to provide
          		disk storage that is extremely fast and reliable. However, this
          		storage space is much more expensive than a regular PC hard drive—in
          		fact disk space is a major component of the capital SSCC's budget. We're
          		pleased to provide all the disk space our members need without
          		charging individuals or projects, but please help keep costs
          		down by using disk space wisely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compress large files that are not in active use.</li>
<li>Share large data files among researchers rather than everyone making their own copy</li>
<li>Delete intermediate data files that can be reproduced at will, keeping just the raw data and the version of the data you're currently working on (along with all the code that gets you from one to the other)</li>
<li>Delete data files that are no longer needed (but only if you're sure they're no longer needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Also see <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/linux_disk_space.htm">Managing
          		Disk Space in Linux</a>, and <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/7-8.htm">Using Compressed Data
          		in Linux</a>.          	</p>
<h2><a id="WebDirectories" name="WebDirectories"></a>Web Directories</h2>
<p>In your Linux home directory you will find a directory called <span class="InputCode">PUBLIC_web</span>          		(<span class="MenuOutput">Z:\PUBLIC_web</span> from
          		Windows). This directory can be used for a personal web site
          		(though it must be focused on University business). The Linux
          		directory <span class="InputCode">/usr/global/web</span>,
          		available from Windows as <span class="MenuOutput">\\sscunix.ssc.wisc.edu\web</span>,
          		contains departmental and agency web sites. <span class="InputCode">/usr/global/cgi</span> is
          		used for web scripts. See <a href="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/1-4.htm">Publishing a Web Site
          		on the SSCC's Web Server</a> for more information.</p>
<p>All of these directories are automatically read by the web server,
          		and files and folders placed in them will be available on the
          		web. </p>

<p>This article will show you how to use the SSCC's network disk space from your  Mac.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are not plugged into the wired network in the Sewell Social Science Building, you first need to establish a <a href="https://www.ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/vpn.htm#MacOS">VPN connection</a> to the SSCC network.</li>
<li>Open the <span class="MenuOutput">Finder</span>, then click <span class="MenuOutput">Go</span>, <span class="MenuOutput">Connect to Server</span> or <kbd>⌘ command</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd></li>
<li>In the <span class="MenuOutput">Server Address</span> box, type the URL of the disk space you'd like to connect to from the <a href="#locs">table below</a>.<br/>
<img alt="Adding a server" height="227" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/diskfrommac/diskfrommac_1.jpg" width="489"/> </li>
<li>Click the plus sign (<span class="MenuOutput">+</span>) to save the server in your <span class="MenuOutput">Favorite Servers</span>.</li>
<li>When prompted, enter your SSCC username and password.  If your password contains any special characters (<span class="InputCode">&amp;</span>, <span class="InputCode">@</span>, etc.) type a backslash (<span class="InputCode">\</span>) before that character. Check <span class="MenuOutput">Remember this password in my keychain</span> and you won't be asked to give it again  in the future.<br/>
<img alt="Giving your username and password" height="292" src="https://ssc.wisc.edu/sscc/pubs/screenshots/diskfrommac/diskfrommac_2.jpg" width="428"/></li>
